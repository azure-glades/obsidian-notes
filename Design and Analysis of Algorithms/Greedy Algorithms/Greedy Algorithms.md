Greedy algorithms are commonly used to solve optimization problems
Considers that problems have to solve 1 step at a time, and by taking the best/greediest step each time

Ex:
> Algorithms to create [[Minimum Spanning Tree]]
> [[Dijkstra's Algorithm]]
> [[Prim's Algorithm]]
> [[Kruskal's Algorithm]]
