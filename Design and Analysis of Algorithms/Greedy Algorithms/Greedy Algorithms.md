Greedy algorithms are commonly used to solve optimization problems.
Greedy algorithms always make the greedy choice at every step, i.e it takes the choice which appears to be superior/the best.
1. The choice must be feasible
2. The choice must be optimal locally (the best choice out of them all)
3. The choice *cannot* be reversed

Ex:
> Algorithms to create [[Minimum Spanning Tree]]
> [[Dijkstra's Algorithm]]
> [[Huffman Encoding]]
> [[Fractional Knapsack Problem]]
