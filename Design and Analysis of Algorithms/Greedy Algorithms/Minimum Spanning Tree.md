- A **spanning tree** is a tree that spans/reaches all nodes in a graph without any cycles/loops
- A *minimum-spanning tree* is a spanning tree who’s edge weights are minimum

Prim-Kruskal’s algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find a minimum spanning tree (MST) in a connected, undirected, weighted graph. The MST connects all vertices with the minimum possible total edge weight while avoiding cycles.
