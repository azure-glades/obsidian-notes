Great idea! The **80/20 rule (Pareto Principle)** in programming means focusing on the **core concepts** that will help you solve the majority of problems without getting lost in rare edge cases.

Here’s a structured list of **high-impact topics** that will let you tackle **80% of programming problems** efficiently:

---

### **1. Fundamental Programming Concepts (Absolute Must-Know)**

- **Data Types & Operators** (int, float, boolean, etc.)
- **Conditionals & Loops** (`if`, `while`, `for`)
- **Functions & Recursion** (parameter passing, return types)
- **Basic String & Array Operations** (`substring()`, `split()`, `sort()`, `searching`)

---

### **2. Data Structures (Core Set)**

These give you the foundation for **fast problem-solving**:

- **Arrays & Strings** (two-pointer technique, sliding window)
- **HashMaps & HashSets** (for fast lookup and duplicate detection)
- **Linked Lists** (basic operations, fast pointers)
- **Stacks & Queues** (LIFO/FIFO problems, parentheses matching, BFS)
- **Binary Trees & BSTs** (basic traversal: in-order, pre-order, post-order)
- **Heaps (Priority Queue)** (useful for greedy and shortest path problems)
- **Graphs (Basics)** (BFS, DFS, adjacency list representation)

---

### **3. Algorithmic Patterns**

Instead of memorizing algorithms, **focus on patterns that repeat across problems**:

- **Sliding Window** (used in many substring and array problems)
- **Two Pointers** (merging sorted arrays, linked lists)
- **Sorting + Binary Search** (sorting-based greedy problems, search optimizations)
- **Backtracking** (permutations, combinations, subset problems)
- **Dynamic Programming (Lite Version)** (subproblems, memoization, tabulation)
- **Greedy Algorithms** (activity selection, interval problems)
- **Graph Traversal (BFS & DFS Basics)** (shortest path, cycle detection)

---

### **4. Key Algorithms**

You don’t need to know **everything**, but these cover a lot of ground:

- **Sorting**: QuickSort, MergeSort (or just use Java’s `Arrays.sort()`)
- **Binary Search** (finding elements in sorted data, searching for conditions)
- **Kadane’s Algorithm** (maximum subarray sum, important for DP)
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** (shortest path in graphs)
- **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU)** (connected components)
- **Basic Dynamic Programming**: Fibonacci, Knapsack (for building intuition)

---

### **5. Math & Number Theory (for General Problem-Solving)**

- **Modulo Arithmetic** (for large numbers)
- **Bit Manipulation Basics** (`XOR`, `AND`, `OR`, shifting)
- **Prime Numbers & Sieve of Eratosthenes**
- **GCD & LCM (Euclidean Algorithm)**
- **Combinatorics Basics** (`nCr`, `n!`)

---

### **How to Apply the 80/20 Rule Efficiently**

1. **Identify Patterns** – Solve problems **by recognizing the pattern**, not memorizing solutions.
2. **Time-Bound Practice** – Set **timed problem-solving sessions** to improve speed.
3. **Learn by Doing** – Implement core algorithms **from scratch** to truly understand them.
4. **Review & Analyze** – After solving a problem, compare it with the best solutions.

---

### **What This Won’t Cover (The 20%)**

- Advanced data structures (Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees, Tries)
- Complex Dynamic Programming (bitmasking, matrix exponentiation)
- Highly optimized Graph Algorithms (Floyd-Warshall, Bellman-Ford)
- Niche algorithmic topics (Game Theory, Computational Geometry)

But **you rarely need these** unless you're aiming for **competitive programming at a high level**.

### **How This Fits Into Your Current Work**

Since you’re doing **Striver’s DSA sheet in Java**, use this list to **prioritize topics** and **skip less important ones for now**. Would you like me to suggest **problems** for each category based on your current progress?
