Solving a problem into an intermediate problem that can then be solved easily.

problem (transform) → intermediate problem (conquer) → solution

1. **Instance simplification**: Convert the problem into a simpler/convenient instance. Ex: AVL Tree, presorting
2. **Representation change**: Transform the problem into a different representation (but same problem). Makes it easier to solve. Ex: 2-3 Tree, [[Heap sort]]
3. **Problem Reduction:** Transformation to an instance of a different problem for which a solution already exists. Ex: To find LCM of 2 numbers, one can just find the GCD first and get LCM quickly $$\text{LCM}(a,b) = \frac{a*b}{\text{GCD}(x,y)}$$
