Okay, here's a detailed briefing document summarizing the provided source on GMOs, LMOs, and relevant regulations:

**Briefing Document: Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) and Biosafety Regulations**

**Executive Summary:**

This document provides an overview of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), also referred to as Living Modified Organisms (LMOs), their applications, the current state of their development, safety concerns, international regulatory approaches, and the specific situation of biosafety regulations in Bhutan. It highlights the core concepts of genetic modification, the technology used, the benefits, risks, and the need for rigorous safety assessments. The briefing also covers international agreements like the Cartagena Protocol and discusses methods for detecting and quantifying GMOs.

**1. Introduction to GMOs/LMOs:**

- **Definition:** GMOs/LMOs are organisms in which the genetic material (DNA) has been artificially altered to improve traits or perform new functions.
- "A Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) is that in which the basic genetic material (DNA) has been artificially altered or modified to improve the attributes or make it perform new functions."
- **Basic Principle:** Genetic modification involves copying and transferring genes between organisms, made possible because the genetic code (DNA) is universal.
- "Genetic modification involving the copying and transfer of genes from one organism to another is possible because the genetic code is universal..."
- **Key Components of Genetic Modification:DNA:** The molecule carrying the genetic blueprint. Consists of four bases: adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine.
- **Gene:** A segment of DNA encoding instructions for cell function.
- **Genome:** An organism's complete set of genes.
- **Recombinant DNA Technology:** Uses restriction endonucleases to cut DNA and DNA ligases to recombine them.
- **Vectors:** Used to introduce foreign genes into host cells.
- **Marker Genes:** Used for selection and identification of modified cells.

**2. Development of GMOs:**

1. **Steps:**Identification of a gene with a desirable characteristic.
2. Cloning the gene.
3. Transferring the gene into a target organism.
4. Selection of the successfully modified organism.

**3. Applications of GMOs:**

- **Healthcare:** Production of therapeutic proteins, vaccines, and pharmaceuticals.
- **Agriculture:** Development of crops with enhanced traits such as:
- Herbicide tolerance (e.g., Roundup Ready soybeans).
- Insect resistance (e.g., Bt crops).
- "Bt cotton and maize which have increased resistance to boll worms have been developed and cultivated since 1996."
- Stress tolerance (e.g., drought and cold resistance).
- Improved nutrition (e.g., Golden Rice).
- Delayed ripening.
- **Process Industry:** Production of enzymes and other products.
- **Environment:** Use of GMOs for bioremediation and bioplastics.
- "Plants and microbes have also been genetically modified to produce polyhydroxybutyrate, a feedstock for producing biodegradable plastics."

**4. Global Status of GM Crops:**

- **Widespread Adoption:** GM crops have been cultivated since 1996, with millions of hectares in over 30 countries.
- **Major Cultivators:** USA, Brazil, Argentina, Canada, India, and China.
- **Common GM Crops:** Alfalfa, canola, cotton, maize, papaya, polar, soybean, sweet pepper, squash, sugarbeet, and tomato.
- "In decreasing order of hecterrage under transgenics, USA, Brazil, Argentina, Canada, India, China, Paraguay, South Africa, Pakistan, Uruguay, Bolivia and Philippines grew more than 1 million hectares."
- **Future GM Crops:** Research focuses on drought-tolerant crops, golden rice, and high-yielding varieties.

**5. Safety Assessment of GM Crops:**

- **Case-by-Case Approach:** Safety concerns vary depending on the specific gene-organism combination.
- "This means that the concerns associated with use of GMOs can differ greatly depending on the particular gene-organism combination and therefore a case-by-case approach is required for assessment of safety concerns."
- **Potential Risks:**Allergenicity.
- Toxicity.
- Environmental impact (gene flow, effects on non-target organisms).
- **Risk Analysis:** A scientific process using the best available knowledge to assess and manage risk.
- **Assessment Procedures:**Detailed molecular biology of the GM crop.
- Characterization of host organisms and gene inserts.
- Human health safety assessment (toxicity, allergenicity, nutritional analysis).
- Environmental safety assessment.

**6. International Approaches to Biosafety Regulations:**

- **National Regulatory Regimes:** Most countries have agencies that regulate GM products. Examples include the EPA in the US, Environment Canada, the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator in Australia, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and the National Committee on Biosafety in the Philippines.
- **International Initiatives:** The OECD, Codex Alimentarius Commission, WHO, and FAO have developed guidelines for safety assessments.
- **OECD:** Has produced consensus documents addressing various aspects of biotechnology, and maintains a biosafety database.
- **WHO/FAO:** Provide advice to member states on scientific and technical issues related to GM foods, and have helped develop the principle of "substantial equivalence."
- **"Substantial Equivalence":** Compares a GM product to its non-GM counterpart.
- "the safety assessment of GM crops is undertaken by comparing the GM product with the non-GM counterpart is referred to as “substantial equivalence”."
- This assumes traditionally cultivated crops are a baseline for safety. It involves a tiered approach: if substantial equivalence is met no further testing is needed, if there are minor differences then those are specifically assessed, and if a product is completely different then more extensive testing is required.
- **Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety:**Aims to ensure safe transfer, handling, and use of LMOs.
- Requires risk assessments for LMOs released into the environment.
- "Article 15 of the Protocol requires that scientifically sound risk assessment be performed for decisions on import of LMOs to be released into the environment,..."
- Has been ratified by 167 countries as of July 2014.
- The Ad Hoc Technical Expert Group (AHTEG) develops guidance on risk assessments for LMOs, including areas like stacked genes, abiotic stress tolerance, and post-release monitoring.

**7. Status of Biosafety Regulations in Bhutan:**

- **Initial Ban:** Bhutan issued a ministerial decree in 2000 banning all GMO imports.
- **Food Act of Bhutan:** Sections addressing food safety from GM products have been added in the Food Act of Bhutan (2005).
- **Organic Bhutan Policy:** Bhutan is branded as an ‘Organic Bhutan’ for the world, influencing biosafety regulations.
- **Current Approach:** A draft Biosafety Bill (2014) is being considered. It may ban GM reproducing materials while allowing GMO foods, feeds, and processing products (FFPs).
- "GMO plants, animals, seeds, semen and embryos - any GM biological material capable of reproducing - may be banned in Bhutan to protect the country’s rich biological diversity and the well-being of the people...GMO foods, feeds, and processing (FFPs) can be permitted since Bhutan imports more than 35% of FFPs from neighboring countries..."
- **Key Laws and Regulations:** The Livestock Act, Plant Quarantine Act, Seeds Act, and Biodiversity Act all play a role in Biosafety.

**8. Detection of GMOs/LMOs:**

- **Methods:Protein-based methods:** Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).
- **DNA/RNA-based methods:** Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Real-time PCR (qPCR).
- **RNA-based detection:** Involves converting RNA to DNA via reverse transcription.
- **DNA-based methods:** Primarily based on amplifying specific DNA sequences with PCR.
- **Event-Specific Detection:** Methods that target junctions between the insert and the host genome for more reliable results.
- "Consequently, the junction between the integration site and the insert will be unique for each transformation event."
- **Quantification:**Competitive quantitative PCR
- Real-time PCR for quantifying GMO content.
- **Key Considerations for Detection:** Limits of detection, specificity, and validation are important for accurate GMO testing.
