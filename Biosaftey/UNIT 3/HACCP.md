**Introduction to HACCP**
- **HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point)** is a management system focused on food safety.
- It addresses biological, chemical, and physical hazards throughout the food production process, from raw material handling to consumption.
- The primary goal of HACCP is to **prevent and reduce food safety hazards**.
- It is based on the application of scientific principles to food processing and production.
- The University of Nebraska has provided educational programs and assistance in this field since 1993.
- HACCP training is relevant for meat and poultry processors, general food processors, and food service operators.
- **Question:** Explain the importance of the HACCP system in ensuring food safety. (8 marks)
    - _Consider discussing how HACCP proactively addresses hazards, its comprehensive approach, and its use of scientific principles. You could also emphasize the prevention over reaction aspect of HACCP._

**The Seven Principles of HACCP**
- The HACCP system is based on seven key principles, which are the most important steps in writing a HACCP plan.
- The first two principles establish the foundation for the plan, while the remaining five are the application steps.

**Principle 1: Conduct a Hazard Analysis**
- This involves listing all the steps in the food production process.
- It also includes identifying where significant hazards are likely to occur.
- The focus is on hazards that can be prevented, eliminated, or controlled by the HACCP plan    
- A justification for including or excluding a hazard must be documented along with possible control measures.
- **Question:** What are the key components of conducting a hazard analysis under HACCP? (8 marks)
    - _Mention the steps, the types of hazards, and the documentation and control measures._

**Principle 2: Determine Critical Control Points (CCPs)**
- A **CCP** is a point, step, or procedure where control can be applied to prevent, eliminate, or reduce a food safety hazard to an acceptable level.
- A CCP decision tree is often used to identify critical control points in the process.
- A single CCP may control more than one hazard, and multiple CCPs may be needed to control a single hazard.
- The number of CCPs depends on the specific processing steps and the required level of control to ensure food safety.
- **Question:** Explain the concept of a Critical Control Point (CCP) and its significance in a HACCP plan. (8 marks)
    - _Define CCP, describe its purpose, and the ways to find them, and their importance to controlling hazards._

**Principle 3: Establish Critical Limits**
- A **critical limit (CL)** is the maximum and/or minimum value to which a biological, chemical, or physical parameter must be controlled at a CCP.
- The purpose of a CL is to prevent, eliminate, or reduce a food safety hazard to an acceptable level.
- Critical limits are usually measured in terms of time, temperature, water activity, pH, weight, or other scientifically or regulatorily determined parameters.
- **Question:** How are critical limits established, and what is their role in maintaining food safety? (8 marks)
    - _Discuss the definition of critical limits, types of measurements used, and the importance of scientific and regulatory standards._

**Principle 4: Establish Monitoring Procedures**
- Monitoring procedures involve measuring the critical limit at each CCP.
- These procedures detail how the measurement will be taken, when it will be taken, who is responsible, and how frequently it occurs during production.
- **Question:** Describe the key elements of effective monitoring procedures in a HACCP system. (8 marks)
    - _Outline what is measured, how, when, and by whom._

**Principle 5: Establish Corrective Actions**
- Corrective actions are procedures that are followed when a deviation from a critical limit occurs.
- This includes steps to prevent potentially hazardous food from entering the food chain and to correct the process.
- Corrective actions also involve identifying problems and implementing steps to prevent their recurrence.
- **Question:** What are the main goals of corrective actions in a HACCP plan? (8 marks)
    - _Explain the immediate and long-term goals such as preventing hazards and improving the process for the future._

**Principle 6: Establish Verification Procedures**
- Verification procedures are activities, aside from monitoring, that determine if the HACCP plan is valid and operating as intended.
- This may include activities such as auditing CCPs, reviewing records, prior shipment reviews, instrument calibration, and product testing.
- **Question:** What is the difference between monitoring and verification in a HACCP plan? (8 marks)
    - _Discuss the specific purposes and activities involved in each process, and how they are connected to ensuring food safety._

**Principle 7: Establish Record-Keeping and Documentation Procedures**
- A key component of a HACCP plan is maintaining records that can prove food safety.
- Records also need to contain information about the HACCP plan itself, including the HACCP Team, product description, flow diagrams, hazard analysis, CCPs, Critical Limits, Monitoring System, Corrective Actions, Recordkeeping Procedures, and Verification Procedures.
- **Question:** Why is comprehensive record-keeping important in a HACCP system? (8 marks)
    - _Explain that record keeping is evidence that the food was produced safely, and also has other purposes for analysis and compliance._

These notes and questions should provide a good foundation for studying the HACCP system. Remember to review the material, think critically about each principle, and consider how they interconnect to ensure food safety.
