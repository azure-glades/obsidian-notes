Used in [[BGP - Exterior Gateway Routing Protocol]]
It is used in ERP (exterior routing protocols) because u construct a path/spanning tree of possible routes through all the different ASâ€™s and then u select the best path to take based on your routing policy.

since u know where each path/AS lies you can control where your traffic flows through and you can also reject incoming traffic.

- There is no distance/cost estimate in path vector routing
- each block of routing information lists all of the ASs visited in order to reach the destination network by this route
