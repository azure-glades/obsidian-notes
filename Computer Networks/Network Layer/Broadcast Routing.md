Messages are sent to every computer on the network is called broadcasting.
- The main problem with broadcasting is the number of copy/repeat packets in generates which need to be culled

# How to do broadcast routing?
**Send a packet to all destinations in network** : The sources sends a distinct packet to every destination. Easy to implement but needs a lot of work on the source router
## Multi-destination routing
This approach optimizes broadcast traffic by:
1. **Packet Structure**: Including a list of all destination addresses within a single packet
2. **Router Processing**:
    - The router examines all destinations in the packet.
    - Identifies the optimal output lines required to reach at least one destination in the list
3. **Packet Splitting**:
    - Generates a new copy of the packet for each necessary output line.
    - Partitions the destination list among these copies, assigning only relevant destinations to each line
## Flooding
Packet is sent to all neighbours who forward it to all of their neighbours. Generates a huge number of packets exponentially which floods the network.
To limit the number of flood packets
- Age
- hop count
- reverse path forwarding

> Reverse path forwarding
> The destination looks at the route to the source of packet. If the packet arrived on the link it wouldâ€™ve used, the router considers it as the first packet and forwards it to all other links. Else it is considered a copy and discarded.

> Reverse path forwarding vs flooding
> - The broadcast packet is sent only once in each direction.
> - It requires the routers know how to reach all destinations without needing to remember sequence numbers or list all destinations in the packet.
> - Easy to implement.

## Using a spanning tree
A spanning tree is needed for broadcast routing to **prevent loops** in networks with redundant paths, which can cause broadcast storms and network congestion[1](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/spanning-tree-protocol)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_Tree_Protocol)[5](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/spanning-tree-protocol). By creating a loop-free topology, it ensures:
1. **Elimination of infinite loops**: Blocks redundant paths, stopping data from circulating endlessly[1](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/spanning-tree-protocol)[5](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/spanning-tree-protocol).
2. **Controlled broadcast propagation**: Broadcasts follow a single tree structure, reaching all nodes without duplication[4](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-263j-data-communication-networks-fall-2002/e4e5a5f72a2876efee7a9a4c4a0a715b_Lecture19.pdf)[7](https://networklessons.com/spanning-tree/spanning-tree-stp-limitations).
3. **Fault tolerance**: Automatically activates backup paths if primary links fail, maintaining connectivity[3](https://www.jetking.com/blog/spanning-tree-protocol-explained)[6](https://www.auvik.com/franklyit/blog/first-deployment-spanning-tree/).
Without a spanning tree, redundant links in switched networks lead to MAC table instability, packet duplication, and degraded performance[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_Tree_Protocol)[5](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/spanning-tree-protocol)[7](https://networklessons.com/spanning-tree/spanning-tree-stp-limitations).
