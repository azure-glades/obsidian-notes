Bandwidth, Delay, Jitter, and Loss
- Bandwidth : Maximum capacity of a wired or wireless communications link to transmit data over a network connection in a given amount of time
- Delay :  Amount of time taken by a packet to reach destination from the source
- Jitter : Comparison drawn between the delivery of the packets
- Loss : Occurs when a network packet fails to reach its expected destination, resulting in information loss
