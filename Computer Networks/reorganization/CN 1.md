Layers of networks:
Physical layer -> Data link layer -> Network Layer -> Transport layer -> Application layer

TCP/IP Model
OSI Model -> RFC documents are guidelines for using various protocols

Network Criteria
1. Performance: Bandwidth, response time, packet loss, latency, transit time
2. Security: Prevent unauthorized access, ensure packet privacy, encryption
3. Reliability: Frequency of failure, network access, connectivity

Types of connections
1. Point to point (p2p)
2. Multipoint

Network topology:
1. Mesh
2. Star
3. Ring
4. Bus

Network types
1. LAN: Restricted corporate networks that span a campus or an institution where local computers of the location connect to and access each other or the internet
2. WAN: Wide area networks that span towns and localities and consist of various LANs and personal computers
	- Switched WAN
	- Point to point WAN
3. Internetwork: WANs and LANs are connected to each other to form the internet.

Circuit switching network
Packet-switching network

> Differentiate p2p and multipoint connection with example
> Differentiate ring topology and bus topology with advantages and disadvantages

| P2P                                                 | Multipoint                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Private communication line between devices          | Lines of communication are shared                       |
| Multiple paths present between devices              | Single path present between devices                     |
| Requires more cabling                               | Less cabling                                            |
| Can continue functioning even if a connection fails | The network fully fails if the central connection fails |
| Ex: Internet                                        | Ex:Mainframe networks                                   |

| Ring                                                               | Bus                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A set of repeaters connected in a ring                             | A sing                                                                         |
| Repeaters determine whether the packet is at the right destination | Bus lines determine whether packet reaches destination                         |
| Advantage: Less cabling, simple architecture, more expensive       | Advantage: Less expensive since repeaters and network devices are not required |
| Disadvantage: Data can be intercepted by any device on the network | Disadvantage: If the bus fails the whole system fails                          |
|                                                                    |                                                                                |
