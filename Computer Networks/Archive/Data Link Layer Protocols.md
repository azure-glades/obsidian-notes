# Data Link Layer Protocols
- Protocol that manages flow, error and congestion control.
-  **Connectionless protocol:** No connection between the frames. Each frame is sent independently
- **Connection oriented** Logical connection exists between frames and are sent in order. Common in p2p protocols
	- 4 protocols exist: simple, stop-and-wait, go-back-N, and selective-repeat
> Ex: Ethernet, IEEE 802.11 Wireless, Frame Relay, [[HDLC]], [[PPP]]

FSMs are used to explain the working of protocols
Following are some protocol designs:
## **Simple protocol** 
Does not implement error control or flow control. Just sends packets between nodes. Assumed that the receiver always gets perfect packets and never gets overloaded

## **Stop-and-wait protocol** 
Implements error and flow control. The sender sends a packet and waits for acknowledgement from receiver before sending the next one![[Pasted image 20250318104629.png]]

- Sender has 2 states:
	- *ready state:* waiting for packet from network layer. When it gets a packet, it frames and copies the packet, starts the timer and sends the frame
	- *blocking state:* 
		- sender resends frame if timer expires
		- resends frame if ACK is corrupted
		- stops timer, deletes copy and moves to ready state if ACK is error-free
- Receiver has 1 state: Always in ready state
	- If error free frame arrives, it sends an ACK back to the sender
	- If corrupted frame arrives, it silently discards it. 

>[!note]+ Piggybacking
> A concept involved in duplex (2-way) communication.
> When both Alice and Bob are communicating, Alice bundles her ACK for Bobâ€™s message with her message, and hence Bob receives the acknowledgement for his previous message along with the new reply from Alice. This saves bandwidth and latency
