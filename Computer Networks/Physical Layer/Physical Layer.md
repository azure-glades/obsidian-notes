The layer that handles sending data across links
- No encapsulation occurs here
- Modems, Signal generators, and signal processing devices are present
- *Bits* are the basic unit of data that is transferred

# Transmission Modes
Data transmission modes define how information is sent between devices, focusing on the direction and method of data flow.

## Parallel Transmission
Grouping and transferring n bits of data in n different channels in a single clock cycle is parallel transmission.
*Advantage:* Transmission speed is high
*Disadvantage:* More expensive

## Serial Transmission
All bits are transferred in a single channel, taking up n clock cycles to transmit is serial transmission
*Advantage:* Cost effective
*Disadvantage:* Expensive
