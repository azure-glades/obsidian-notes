The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) enables routers to monitor network operations and report unexpected events during packet processing

| **Type**  | **Name**                          | **Description**                                                                                                | **Status**     |
| --------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **0**     | Echo Reply                        | Response to an Echo Request (used in `ping`).                                                                  | Active         |
| **3**     | Destination Unreachable           | Sent when a packet cannot be delivered (e.g., network/host unreachable, fragmentation needed but DF flag set). | Active         |
| **4**     | Source Quench                     | Historically requested senders to slow transmission (deprecated due to inefficiency).                          | **Deprecated** |
| **5**     | Redirect                          | Instructs hosts to use a better route for future packets.                                                      | Active         |
| **8**     | Echo Request                      | Tests destination reachability (triggered by `ping`).                                                          | Active         |
| **11**    | Time Exceeded                     | Indicates a packet was discarded due to TTL=0 (Code 0) or fragment reassembly timeout (Code 1).                | Active         |
| **12**    | Parameter Problem                 | Reports header field errors (e.g., invalid IP options).                                                        | Active         |
| **13/14** | Timestamp Request/Reply           | Measures round-trip time and synchronizes clocks.                                                              | Active         |
| **9/10**  | Router Advertisement/Solicitation | Allows hosts to discover nearby routers.                                                                       | Active         |

#### 1. Network Diagnostics  
- `ping` Utility: Uses **Echo Request (Type 8)** and **Echo Reply (Type 0)** to verify host reachability and measure latency.  
- `traceroute` Utility: Exploits **Time Exceeded (Type 11)** messages by incrementing TTL values to map the path to a destination.  

#### 2. Error Reporting
- Destination Unreachable (Type 3):  
  - Code 0 (Network Unreachable): Router has no route to the network.  
  - Code 1 (Host Unreachable): Host is down or unreachable.  
  - Code 3 (Port Unreachable): Application not listening on the requested port.  
  - Code 4 (Fragmentation Needed): Packet exceeds MTU but has DF (Don’t Fragment) flag set.  

- Time Exceeded (Type 11):  
  - Code 0 (TTL Expired): Packet discarded due to TTL=0 (used in `traceroute`).  
  - Code 1 (Fragment Reassembly Timeout): All fragments didn’t arrive in time.  

#### 3. Deprecated and Experimental Messages  
- **Source Quench (Type 4)**: Obsolete due to inefficiency (modern networks use TCP congestion control).  
- **Timestamp (Type 13/14)**: Rarely used today due to NTP (Network Time Protocol).  

### **How `traceroute` Works**  
1. Sends packets with **TTL=1** → First router decrements TTL to **0**, discards packet, and sends **Time Exceeded (Type 11)**.  
2. Next, sends packets with **TTL=2** → Second router responds with **Time Exceeded**.  
3. Repeats until the destination replies with **Echo Reply (Type 0)** or **Port Unreachable (Type 3, Code 3)**.  

### **Security Considerations**  
- ICMP can be abused in **DDoS attacks** (e.g., **ICMP flood**, **Smurf attack**).  
- Some networks block ICMP for security, but this can hinder troubleshooting.
