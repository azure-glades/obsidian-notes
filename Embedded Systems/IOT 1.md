| **Definition**          | A compact integrated circuit with a CPU, memory (RAM, ROM), and I/O peripherals all on a single chip. | A standalone CPU that requires external components like RAM, ROM, and I/O peripherals for operation |
| **Purpose**             | General Purpose                                                                                       | Specific Task                                                                                       |
| **Architecture**        | Based on Harvard architecture (separate memory for instructions and data)                             | Based on Von Neumann architecture (shared memory for instructions and data)                         |
| **Applications**        | Used in embedded systems for specific tasks (e.g., IoT devices, appliances, automotive systems).      | Used in general-purpose computing (e.g., personal computers, servers)                               |
| **Integration**         | Self-contained with integrated memory and peripherals                                                 | Requires external components for memory and interfacing.                                            |
| **Processing Power**    | Limited processing power optimized for low-power operations                                           | Higher processing power suitable for complex tasks like graphics and data analysis                  |
| **Cost and Complexity** | Inexpensive, simpler design                                                                           | More expensive and complex due to external components and higher performance capabilities           |
| **Power Consumption**   | Low power consumption                                                                                 | Higher power consumption due to external interfacing and higher performance demands                 |
