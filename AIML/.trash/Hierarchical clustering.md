Used to make clusters that map to classes and sub-classes.

# Agglomerative clustering
Start with small clusters, and iteratively combine clusters together to get larger super-clusters

# Divisive clustering
Start with a single large cluster, and iteratively divide into smaller clusters to get sub-clusters.


Cluster difference measures -
1. Minimum distance between clusters
2. Maximum distance between clusters
3. Mean distance between cluster centers
4. Average distance between clusters
