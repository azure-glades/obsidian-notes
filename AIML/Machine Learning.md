A machine learning algorithm is an algorithm that is able to learn from data.
It is made of 
1. The Task, T
2. The Performance Measure, P
3. The Experience, E

Task -> the problem to solve
Performance measure -> To evaluate how well it is solving the problem
Experience -> The data set it will learn from
