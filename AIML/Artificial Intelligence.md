Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, reason, perceive, make decisions, and solve problems.
- Thought process and reasoning
- Behaviour
Computer: Intelligent enough to process and analyse data
Machine: No intelligence. Waits for instructions from a computer

# Quantifying Intelligence
Intelligence can be gauged from a *human-centered* standpoint. human-centered = empirical approach to how humans think and percieve

Intelligence can also be gauged from a *rationalist appraoch*. Something that thinks and behaves rationally.
$\text{Rational Approach} = \text{Mathematics} + \text{Engineering}$
