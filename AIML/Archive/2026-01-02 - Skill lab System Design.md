Good design
- scalability
- maintainability
- efficiency
- reliability

## Concepts
Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance - CAP theorem
- Only 2 of these can be maintained at the same time
	- CA
	- AP
	- CP

Caching - AP optimization (high availability, partition tolerance (distributed cache) )
- storing frequently accessed data in faster storage

types of caching
- browser caching
- server caching
- database caching -> cache common queries and outputs
- CDNs 

Load balancing

Database scaling
1. Vertical scaling - scale up
	- better cpu, more ram, more storage, upgrade network
2. Horiz scaling - scale out
	- replication --> more servers -> but consistency issues. many approaches to consistency
	- database sharding
