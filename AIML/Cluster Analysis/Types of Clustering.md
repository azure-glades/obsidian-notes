These represent the different strategies or "philosophies" used to group data points.

### 1. Partitional Clustering
This method divides data points into non-overlapping subsets (clusters) such that each data point is in **exactly one** cluster.
- **Key Algorithm:** K-means, K-medoids
- **Analogy:** Dividing a deck of cards into four distinct piles by suit.
### 2. Hierarchical Clustering
This creates a structure of clusters that looks like a tree (called a **Dendrogram**).
- **Agglomerative (Bottom-Up):** Start with each point as its own cluster and merge the closest ones until only one cluster remains.
- **Divisive (Top-Down):** Start with one giant cluster and split it repeatedly.
### 3. Density-Based Clustering
Instead of looking for centers or distances, this looks for regions where data points are "packed" closely together. It can find clusters of arbitrary shapes and ignores "noise" (outliers).
- **Key Algorithm:** DBSCAN.
### 4. Grid-Based Approach
This approach quantizes the object space into a finite number of cells that form a **grid structure**. All clustering operations are performed on this grid rather than the raw data points, making it exceptionally fast for large datasets.
- **Key Algorithm:** STING (Statistical Information Grid), CLIQUE.
- **Analogy:** Dividing a map of a city into a grid of squares and counting how many people live in each square to find "busy" zones, rather than tracking every individual person's coordinates.
### 5. Model-Based Approach
This method assumes that the data is generated by a mixture of underlying **probability distributions**. It attempts to find the best fit between the given data and some mathematical model (usually statistical).
- **Key Algorithm:** Expectation-Maximization (EM), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).
- **Analogy:** Looking at a crowd and assuming they are a mix of two different groups (e.g., tourists and locals) based on their walking speed, then calculating the probability that each person belongs to one group or the other.
### 6. Frequent Pattern-Based Clustering
This technique looks for clusters based on **patterns or attributes** that frequently occur together in a dataset. It is often used in high-dimensional data where traditional distance measures fail.
- **Key Algorithm:** pCluster, Frequent Itemset Clustering.
- **Analogy:** In a grocery store database, grouping customers together not by their age, but because they all frequently buy the specific combination of "Milk, Bread, and Diapers."
### 7. User-Guided / Constraint-Based Clustering
This approach allows the user to steer the clustering process by providing **specific constraints** or domain knowledge (e.g., "these two items _must_ be together" or "these two _cannot_ be together").
- **Key Algorithm:** COD-CLARANS.
- **Analogy:** Sorting a playlist where you tell the AI, "No matter what, these two specific songs must always be in the same mood category."
### 8. Link-Based Clustering
Instead of looking at the attributes of the objects, this method focuses on the **relationships (links)** between them. It is widely used in social network analysis and web page ranking.
- **Key Algorithm:** SimRank, LinkClus.
- **Analogy:** Determining "friend groups" in a school by looking at who follows whom on social media, rather than looking at the students' grades or hobbies.
