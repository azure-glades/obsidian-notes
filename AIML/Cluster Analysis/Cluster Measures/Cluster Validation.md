Cluster validation (also called *cluster evaluation*) is a process of quantifying how good the clustering is.

Importance of cluster validation
1. Distinguishing whether there actually exists non-random clusters/structures in data
2. Determining the **clustering tendency** of a set of data, i.e., distinguishing whether non-random structure actually exists in the data.  
3. Determining the correct number of clusters.  
4. Evaluating how well the results of a cluster analysis fit the data *without* reference to external information.  
5. Comparing the results of a cluster analysis to externally known results, such as externally provided class labels.  
6. Comparing two sets of clusters to determine which is better.

Types of validation
1. When we only have the dataset -> [[Internal Validation]]
2. When we also have the actual classes -> [[External Validation]]
