A computer has 3 areas of memory
1. **Stack**: Fixed size of memory called system stack that can only be accessed from top to bottom (Like a stack of plates. Plates can be stacked one on top of the other. But to access a plate it has to be accessed from top to bottom).
2. **Heap**: Contiguous block of memory that can be randomly assigned based on need. Need not be accessed in order and addresses are stored as pointers to portions of memory. Heap is smaller than stack. 
3. **Global Memory**: main() is stored in global memory
