Got it! To help you recall Java, we can start with a quick review of the fundamentals. Here's a suggested approach:

1. **Core Syntax and Basics**:
    
    - Variables and Data Types
    - Control Structures (if-else, loops)
    - Arrays and Strings
2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
    
    - Classes and Objects
    - Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation
    - Interfaces and Abstract Classes
3. **Key Libraries and Features**:
    
    - Collections Framework (Lists, Maps, etc.)
    - Exception Handling
    - File I/O
4. **Practical Exercises**:
    
    - Small programs to reinforce concepts (e.g., a calculator, sorting algorithms, etc.)
5. **Advanced Concepts (Optional)**:
    
    - Threads and Concurrency
    - Streams and Lambda Expressions (Java 8+)
    - JDBC for database interaction

Would you like to begin with a topic, or should I suggest a practical exercise to jog your memory?
