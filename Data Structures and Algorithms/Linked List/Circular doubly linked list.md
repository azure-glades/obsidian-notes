## Application of linked list
Circular doubly linked lists offer unique advantages due to their bidirectional traversal and circular structure. Here are five distinct applications of circular doubly linked lists:

1. **Multiplayer Game Management**: In multiplayer games, circular doubly linked lists can manage player turns efficiently. Each player is represented as a node, allowing the game to cycle through players for turn-based actions without needing to reset to the start after reaching the last player.

2. **Event Scheduling**: Circular doubly linked lists can be used in event-driven systems to manage scheduled events. Each event can be a node in the list, allowing for easy traversal and execution of events in a cyclic manner, which is useful for recurring events.

3. **Task Management in Operating Systems**: Operating systems can utilize circular doubly linked lists for managing tasks in a round-robin scheduling algorithm. Each task is represented as a node, and the scheduler can easily cycle through tasks for execution, ensuring fair CPU time distribution.

4. **Circular Buffers**: Circular doubly linked lists are ideal for implementing circular buffers, where data is continuously written and read in a cyclic manner. This is particularly useful in scenarios like streaming data or buffering in network applications, where old data can be overwritten by new data seamlessly.

5. **Music or Video Streaming Services**: In streaming applications, circular doubly linked lists can manage playlists that allow users to loop through songs or videos continuously. Each track or video is represented as a node, enabling users to play content in a seamless loop without interruptions.
