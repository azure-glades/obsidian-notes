- **Algorithm**: the logic
	- Made at design time
	- Should have domain knowledge (the math)
	- Any language, including maths, or english.
	- hardware-os independant
	- algorithms are *Priori analysis*
- **Program**: the execution of logic
	- Made at implementation time
	- Should have programming knowledge (the design)
	- Programming language
	- hardware-os dependant
	- programs are *Posteriori testing*

#### Characteristics of Algorithm
- May or may-not take inputs
- Always has to give an output
- Every statement is definite and has only 1 meaning. No ambiguity
- Number of statements is finite. The duration of the algorithm is finite
- Algorithm must be effective. There must not be unnecessary steps

#### Analyze an Algorithm
- Time: How long does it take to run an algorithm?
- Space: How much memory/resources/cpu processing power does it take?How much CPU registers are consumed?
- Network consumption: How much data is transferred ?
- Power consumption: How much power is consumed?
