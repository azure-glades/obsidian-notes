using limits to compare orders of growth $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)}=c$$
if c = 0, then f(n) has a smaller order of growth than g(n) » $f(n)\in O[g(n)]$     
if c = constant, then f(n) has same order of growth as g(n) » $f(n)\in \Theta[g(n)]$
if c = infinity, then f(n) has a higher order of growth than g(n) » $f(n)\in \Omega[g(n)]$
