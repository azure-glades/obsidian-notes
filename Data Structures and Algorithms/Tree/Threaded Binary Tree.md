*Definition*:
	A binary tree where address fields store the address of either the **successor** or the **predecessor** node based on the tree traversal.
## Key Characteristics:
1. Address fields (left or right) are used to store links when the respective child is absent:
    - **Left** stores the address of the **predecessor**.
    - **Right** stores the address of the **successor**.
2. **Full Threading**: Both left and right pointers store traversal links.
3. If there is no predecessor or successor, the pointer links to a **header node**:
    - The header node is unique and does not store any data.
    - Its left pointer points to the root of the tree.
    - Its right pointer points to itself.

## Classification of Threaded Binary Trees:
1. **Inorder Threaded Binary Tree**:
    - Divided into **left-threaded**, **right-threaded**, or **fully-threaded** (both left and right threads exist).
2. **Preorder Threaded Binary Tree**.
3. **Postorder Threaded Binary Tree**.

Inorder Traversal of a Threaded Binary Tree
- Since backlinks (threads) exist, traversal is performed **iteratively** without requiring a stack or recursion.
