[[Binary Tree]]
- Efficient storing and re**trie**val data structure
- Tree based data structure
- Root node is empty in a trie
- Compressed trie
- Extremely efficient storing and retrieving
Very useful in searching and autofilling algorithms

Application:
- NLP
- Spell checkers
- Auto suggest
- Auto completions
- Dictionaries in word processors
- Search engines
- Auto command completion
- DNA sequencing (because a lot of DNA is repetetive)
