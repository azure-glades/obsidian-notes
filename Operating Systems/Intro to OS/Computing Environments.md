1. **Traditional Computing**: Desktop computers connected to network and peripherals
2. **Mobile Computing**: Computers in mobile phones and tablets.
	- Cellular/Wireless standards follow IEEE 802.11
	- Common operating systems are Android and iOS
3. **Client Server Computing**: 
	- *Server systems* satisfy requests generated by *Client systems*. 
	- Specialized form of distributed system
	- General structure: ![[Pasted image 20241216104559.png]]
	- Interfacing with server:
		- *Compute-serve interface*: Client sends request to perform an action and server executes it
		- *File-serve interface:* Clients can read, create, delete and update files by directly accessing the server
4. **Peer-to-peer Computing**:
	- A type of distributed system
	- All nodes connected are considered peers and act as client-servers for each other
	- To participate in p2p network:
		- It registers itself with a centralized look-up (called trackers (which can be public or private)) which allows other peers to discover and request service from it.
		- The tracker also stores what node has what service/files/data available for use by the other peers
			- Alternatively, the nodes must discover themselves what sort of services are available by broadcasting to the nodes and requesting for the service. There is no centralized tracker here. A *discovery protocol* enables the discovery of services by peers
	- Ex: Napster, GNUtella 
		- Skype (which uses *VoIP* - Voice over IP). Central system handles login and authentication and communication is over peers

5. **Cloud Computing:**
	- A "cloud" which is a pool of resources (like computing power and storage) that is accessed by clients through the internet/network. 
	- Uses virtualized operating systems that can be accessed by the client to use the cloud servers.
		- Ex: Amazon Elastic CloudComputer (*ec2*)
	- Types of cloud access
		- Public cloud: Available publically over the internet that can be accessed by paying for the service
		- Private cloud: Accessible only across a personal/corporate network and is used only by the corporate entity
		- Hybrid cloud: Accessible by both public and corporate clients.
	- Cloud Services:
		- *SaaS*: Application software are given as a service (Ex: Microsoft 365)
		- *PaaS*: (Platform as a service) Software stack/bundle ready for application use over the internet (Ex: Google cloud platform, AWS)
		- *IaaS*: (Infrastructure as a service) Servers/Storage is made accessible over the internet (Ex: AWS, Storage systems, High performance computing clusters (HPCC))

6. **Real-time Computing**:
	- Computing systems that run continuously, often as embedded systems that control hardware/sensors/controllers
	- Run continuously with minimal user-inputs. Meeting deadlines for tasks is fundamental for embedded system, and hence they always run *real-time operating systems*
	- Often have a set of challenges (like limited memory, computing power, resources)
	- Often run their own OS to handle device specific hardware. Some may run lightweight linux distributions
