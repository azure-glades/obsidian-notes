### Multi-programming
- CPU maintains and runs multiple programs
- Several processes are kept in memory for running
- Process switching occurs when current-running process waits for an event
	- Waiting process causes idle CPU
	- Process-switching occurs and another process starts execution in CPU
		- Old process enters wait queue, and re-enters when current process terminates or waits
	- Prevents CPU idling since a process is always allocated if the CPU starts to idle
	- Process-preemption/context switching is not involved

### Multi-tasking
- CPU maintains and runs multiple processes
- Several processes are continuously switched between running-ready states
- Context switching is seen here. Multiple processes are switched via Interrupts or via I/O user operations
	- Increases *response time*
- Multi-tasking is implemented via Parallel Processing

- To enable multi-tasking and multi-programming, the OS has to choose/schedule the order of execution of tasks. This is handled by the **scheduling algorithm** run by the Scheduler.
- The OS has to allocate memory, files, i/o devices, cache and threads to processes from a common index of resources called the **resource allocation table**. This is an essential task called Resource Management
- These systems provide file/storage management
- Ensure reasonable response time via **virtual memory** which can run programs larger than normal memory

The OS interacts with users, hardware and applications via events, interrupts and system calls

### Dual-Mode
- Mode of operation is a set of permissions that a process carries. OS have atleast 2 modes/rings of operation/permissions
	- *User mode*: Where all user programs reside and the OS communicates to
	- *Kernel mode*: Where all system/OS programs reside. User programs can use kernel resources by communicating via System Calls

> [!info]-
> - The permissions of a process is controlled by the **mode bit** which assigns the mode it runs in \[0 for Kernel and 1 for User mode]

- System Calls provide the means for a user program to ask the operating system to perform tasks reserved for the operating system on the user programâ€™s behalf
	- This prevents malware or erratic users/programs from running *privileged instructions* and causing permanent harm to the computer.
	- Any attempt to run instructions without suitable privileges are rejected
	- EX of privileged instructions
		- I/O control
		- timer management
		- interrupt management

### Multi-mode
- More than 2 modes of operations can also exist -> called protection rings/rings of operation, common in intel chipsets.
- Here, multiple levels of privileges exist, with each level giving access to specific system calls and OS resources

> [!info]+ Timer
> A timer prevents infinite loops in the CPU by interrupting the CPU processes at regular intervals
> - Prevents erratic User programs from generating infinite threads/loops and bogging down the CPU utillization time. 
> - When the timer interrupts, control is transferred to the OS which deals with the running process
> Interrupt time of the timer can be uniform or changed (which is a superuser permission)
