- **Definition**: Making a process wait generally refers to putting a process in a state where it cannot proceed until certain conditions are met. This can be done through various mechanisms, such as explicit wait calls or synchronization primitives.
- **State**: Similar to blocking, when a process is made to wait, it often transitions to either a blocked state (waiting for an event) or may be placed in a suspended state depending on system design.
- **Example**: A thread that calls `wait()` on an object will be made to wait until another thread signals that it can proceed.

| Definition              | Waiting for an event/resource to become available  | General term for halting execution until conditions are met | Temporarily halting execution and possibly moving to disk |
| State                   | Blocked state                                      | Can lead to blocked or suspended states          | Suspended state (may be in secondary storage)     |
| Resource Management      | Does not free up memory                            | May or may not involve resource management       | Frees up memory by moving processes out of RAM     |
