| Feature               | Thread                                                                            | Child Process                                                               |

| **Definition**        | A unit of execution within a process                                              | An independent instance of a program                                        |
| **Resource Usage**    | Lighter; shares resources with the process                                        | Heavier; has its own dedicated resources                                    |
| **Memory**            | Shares memory space with other threads                                            | Has its own independent memory space                                        |
| **Isolation**         | Less isolated; one thread crash can affect others                                 | More isolated; a crash doesn't affect others                                |
| **Communication**     | Easier; direct access to shared memory                                            | More complex; requires IPC (Inter-Process Communication)                    |
| **Creation Time**     | Faster                                                                            | Slower                                                                      |
| **Context Switching** | Faster                                                                            | Slower                                                                      |
| **Complexity**        | Generally simpler to manage within a program                                      | More complex; requires managing separate processes                          |
| **Use Cases**         | Concurrency within a single application; improving performance of CPU-bound tasks | Running independent tasks; isolating processes; executing external programs |
