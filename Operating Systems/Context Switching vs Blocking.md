The concepts of [[Context switching]] and **blocking a process** are fundamental in operating systems, particularly in managing how processes interact with the CPU and shared resources. Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison of the two:

## 1. Context Switching
- **Definition**: Context switching is the process by which an operating system saves the state (context) of a currently running process and loads the state of another process. This allows multiple processes to share a single CPU effectively, creating the illusion of simultaneous execution.
- **Mechanism**: During context switching, the operating system saves the current process's context (including registers, program counter, and other relevant data) into its Process Control Block (PCB). It then retrieves the context of the next scheduled process from its PCB and resumes execution from where it left off.
- **Purpose**: The primary goal is to enable multitasking by allowing multiple processes to share CPU time without interfering with each other. This is crucial for responsive user interfaces and efficient resource utilization.
- **Triggers**: Context switches can occur due to various reasons, such as:
  - A higher-priority process becoming ready to run.
  - The current process completing its time slice.
  - An I/O operation requiring waiting.

## 2. Blocking a Process
- **Definition**: Blocking a process occurs when a process cannot continue its execution until a certain condition is met, typically involving waiting for I/O operations or synchronization events. In this state, the process is moved from the running state to a blocked (or waiting) state.
- **Mechanism**: When a process requests an I/O operation (like reading from disk or waiting for user input), it enters a blocked state. The operating system then schedules another process to run while the blocked process waits for the I/O operation to complete.
- **Purpose**: Blocking helps manage resources efficiently by preventing processes from consuming CPU time while they wait for external events. This allows other processes to utilize CPU resources during these wait times.
- **Triggers**: A process can be blocked due to:
  - Waiting for an I/O operation to complete.
  - Waiting for a resource that is currently unavailable (e.g., acquiring a lock).
