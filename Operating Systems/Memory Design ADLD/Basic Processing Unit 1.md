- **Hardwired Control:** A control unit that implements control logic using physical logic gates and circuits

- **Microprogrammed Control:** A control unit that generates control signals by executing a microprogram stored in a control store.
	- This is a **microutine** - a set of instructions that determine the control sequence



## Hardwired control
**Hardwired control** refers to a method of generating control signals using combinational logic circuits. The process involves several key components:
- **Control Step Counter:** A counter is used to keep track of the steps involved in executing an instruction. Each count of this counter corresponds to one control step.
- **Step Decoder:** This provides a separate signal line for each control step.
- **Instruction Decoder:** This provides a separate line for each instruction.
- **Encoder:** Receives signals from external inputs like MFC (Memory Function Complete) and interrupts, and also from conditional codes like Zero and Negative flags. The encoder combines these signals to generate individual control signals such as Zin, Yin, and PCout.

The control signals are generated in steps, and each step is completed in one clock cycle. Every instruction is a sequence of these control signals. For instance, the signal **Zin** might be asserted during the first step (T1) for all instructions, during step T6 for an ADD instruction, and during step T4 for an unconditional branch instruction. This can be expressed logically as: **Zin = T1 + T6.ADD + T4.BR + ...**.

## Microprogrammed control
**Microprogrammed control** is a method where control signals are generated by a program, similar to machine language programs. In this approach:
- **Control Word (CW):** A control word is a sequence of bits that represent various control signals. Each control step in the control sequence of an instruction corresponds to a unique combination of 1s and 0s within the control word.
- **Microroutine:** A sequence of control words that corresponds to the control sequence of a machine instruction. The individual control words in this microroutine are called microinstructions.
- **Control Store:** The microroutines for all instructions in the instruction set of a computer are stored in a special memory called the control store.

-> IR : instruction register
-> $\mu$ PC: Micro Program Counter -> shows next step of microprogram

Essentially, instead of using hardwired logic to generate control signals, microprogrammed control uses a program stored in a special memory. This method is very flexible because the control sequence can be modified by changing the microprogram.
