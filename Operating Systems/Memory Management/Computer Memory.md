***Computer memory stores information for immediate use in a computer.***
Memory is divided based on the type of storage

> Definitions

- **Bootstrap program**: Program that is loaded immediately when a computer turns on and is responsible for loading the OS
## 1. Volatile memory
Volatile electronic memory storage media. Commonly implemented using semiconductor tech called *Dynamic RAM*.
### 1.1. Registers
### 1.2. Cache

### 1.3. Random Access Memory
Often referred as Main Memory since every running program is loaded onto the RAM before execution.

## 2. Non volatile memory
Permanent memory that retains data even when it is powered off. Permanent memory stores all programs which are loaded into ram when executing. Often use mechanical or electrical forms of memory storage

>[!info]+ EEPROM (Electronically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory)
> Permanent memory storage (present within the motherboard) that is used to store *bootstrap programs*.
