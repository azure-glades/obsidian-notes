### 🎓 **Lecture 39: Text Mining & Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Economics**  
**Instructor**: Adyay Mitra, Assistant Professor at IIT Kharagpur  
**Course**: Artificial Intelligence for Economics

This is one of the last lectures in the course. The focus today is on how **text data** — like news articles, policy documents, social media posts, and reviews — can be analyzed using AI to help economists understand trends, make predictions, and improve decision-making.

We’re going to cover:

1. **Basics of Text Mining & NLP**
2. **Core Tasks in NLP**
3. **Statistical Methods for NLP**
4. **Neural Network (Deep Learning) Methods**
5. **Real-World Case Studies in Economics**

Let’s go step by step.

## 🔤 1. What Is Text Mining & Natural Language Processing?

### ✅ Definitions:
- **Text Mining**: Extracting useful information from large amounts of text.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Teaching computers to understand human language — both written and spoken.

> 💬 Think of it like teaching a robot to read and understand books, tweets, or news just like humans do.

### 🧱 Building Blocks of Text Data

Before any analysis, we need to process raw text into structured data.

#### ➤ Corpus
- A **corpus** is a big collection of documents (e.g., 100 policy reports).
- Each document = sequence of words.

#### ➤ Word Token vs. Word
- A **word token** is each individual occurrence of a word.
- A **word** is unique; multiple tokens can map to the same word.

📌 Example:
> Sentence: *"The vocabulary is part of the vocabulary."*
- "the" appears twice → two **tokens**, but only one **word** ("the").
- So, total tokens = more than total unique words.

#### ➤ Vocabulary
- The set of **all unique words** in the corpus.
- Like a dictionary built from your dataset.

#### ➤ Stop Words
- Common words that often don’t carry deep meaning: *is, the, when, how, etc.*
- Often removed unless needed (like in sentence generation).

🧠 Memory Tip:  
Think of stop words as “filler words” — they hold sentences together but aren't usually key to meaning.

## 🛠️ 2. Why Is NLP Hard? The Big Challenge

Language isn’t just a list of words. It has:
1. **Semantics** – meanings of words
2. **Grammar** – rules about how words fit together
3. **Context** – same word can mean different things

🎯 Goal: Represent text **mathematically** so machines can work with it.

Three pillars of natural language:
| Pillar | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Vocabulary** | List of words used |
| **Grammar** | Rules: which words follow others? |
| **Semantics** | Meaning of words and sentences |

👉 To do NLP well, we must use all three!

---

## 📚 3. Key NLP Tasks (From Simple to Complex)

These are common tasks economists might want to solve using NLP.

---

### ✅ Task 1: Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS)
- Assign each word its grammatical role: noun, verb, adjective, pronoun, etc.

📌 Example:  
*"I like to read books"*  
→ I (pronoun), like (verb), to (particle), read (verb), books (noun)

🧠 Why important? Helps parse sentence structure before deeper analysis.

🔁 Analogy: Labeling ingredients in a recipe — flour, sugar, egg — helps you know what to do next.

---

### ✅ Task 2: Word Sense Disambiguation
- Some words have **multiple meanings**. Figure out which meaning is intended based on context.

📌 Example:
- "Pine": Could mean *a type of tree* OR *to long for something* ("I pine for home")
- "Cone": Ice cream cone OR traffic cone OR pinecone

🔍 How solved? Look at surrounding words!
> "He climbed the mountain and saw a tall pine." → Tree  
> "She pined away after her friend left." → Longed for

🧠 Memory Trick: Same spelling, different sense → check neighbors!

---

### ✅ Task 3: Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Find and classify specific real-world entities in text.

Types include:
- People (e.g., *Rahul Gandhi*)
- Organizations (*Google*, *Reserve Bank of India*)
- Locations (*Mumbai*, *Himalayas*)
- Dates, money, events...

📌 Use in economics: Detect mentions of policies, institutions, outcomes.

Example:  
> "The RBI announced new interest rates on June 5."  
→ RBI = Organization, June 5 = Date, interest rates = Economic variable

🧠 Think: Highlight names in a newspaper article — who, where, when?

---

### ✅ Task 4: Sentiment Analysis
- Determine if a sentence/document expresses **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** emotion.

Can also be graded:
- Strongly positive 😊
- Weakly negative 😐
- Neutral ↔️

📌 Example:
> "This budget was amazing!" → Positive  
> "Prices keep rising, very disappointing." → Negative

⚠️ Challenges:
- Sarcasm: *"Oh great, another tax hike!"* → Sounds positive, actually negative.
- Context matters: “Expensive” is bad for a buyer, good for a seller.

🧠 Real-life analogy: Reading customer reviews to decide whether to buy a product.

💡 Used in economics to study public opinion, market mood, inflation expectations.

---

### ✅ Task 5: Topic Modeling
- Discover hidden themes in a large set of documents.

Imagine having 100 city planning reports. You want to know: What topics do they talk about?

🎯 Output:
- A list of **topics** (e.g., disaster management, urban transport, public health)
- Each topic = group of frequently co-occurring words
- Every word assigned to a topic

📌 Example:
- Topic: **Disaster Management** → words: risk, hazard, recovery, mitigation
- Topic: **Energy Policy** → solar, electricity, grid, renewable

🧠 Important: This is **unsupervised learning** — no labels given. Machine finds patterns itself.

🔄 Like sorting unlabeled boxes into groups based on their contents.

📊 Math behind it: Each topic is a **probability distribution over words**.
- In "Physics", words like *atom*, *force*, *energy* have high probability.
- Words like *socks*, *banana* have near-zero chance.

🔧 Popular Model: **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**

---

### ✅ Task 6: Text Segmentation & Summarization
- **Segmentation**: Break long texts into logical parts (e.g., sections on education, healthcare, infrastructure).
- **Summarization**: Create short summaries of long documents.

🧠 Analogy: Turning a 50-page report into bullet points without losing key ideas.

📌 Useful for policymakers who don’t have time to read everything.

---

## 📊 4. How Do We Solve These Problems? Two Eras of NLP

There are two main ways to approach NLP problems:

| Era | Method | Time Period | Key Idea |
|-----|--------|-----------|--------|
| Old School | Statistical / Probabilistic Models | Pre-2012 | Use math & probability |
| Modern | Neural Networks / Deep Learning | Post-2012 | Use AI brains (like brain networks) |

Let’s explore both.

---

## 🧮 5. Statistical & Probabilistic Methods (Older but Still Useful)

### ➤ Language Models
Goal: Given previous words, predict the next word.

📌 Like Gmail’s auto-complete:  
You type “I am going to”, → system guesses “work”.

Mathematically: Predict P(wₜ | w₁, w₂, ..., wₜ₋₁)  
Probability of next word given past words.

#### ▶️ N-Gram Models (Simple Frequency-Based)
- Only look back at last few words.
- Unigram: P(word) alone
- Bigram: P(word | previous word)
- Trigram: P(word | two previous words)

📌 Example:
> Corpus: “I love cats”, “I love dogs”
> What comes after “I love”? → Either “cats” or “dogs”

Count frequency → build probabilities.

🧠 Limitation: Can’t handle rare or unseen sequences. Doesn’t capture deep meaning.

---

### ➤ Latent Variable Models
Some things we want to find are **hidden** (latent). We infer them from observable text.

Examples of latent variables:
- POS tag of a word
- Topic of a sentence
- Sentiment of a phrase

Used models:
#### 1. Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
- Used for POS tagging.
- Assumes each word has a hidden state (its tag), and transitions between tags follow rules.

📌 Like predicting weather (sunny/rainy) from what people wear — you see clothes (words), guess weather (tags).

#### 2. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
- For **topic modeling**.
- Assumes:
   - There are fixed number of topics
   - Each topic has a word distribution
   - Each document has a topic distribution
   - Each word comes from one topic

🧠 Think: A document is a salad bowl. Ingredients (words) come from different sauces (topics). LDA figures out which sauce each ingredient came from.

---

## 🤖 6. Neural Network Methods (Modern NLP – Since ~2012)

After 2012, deep learning changed everything.

### ➤ Word Embeddings (Revolutionary Concept!)

Instead of treating words as isolated symbols, represent them as **vectors (lists of numbers)** in space.

Why better?
- Similar words → close vectors
- Opposite words → far apart
- Relationships become geometric!

#### ❌ Problem with One-Hot Encoding
- Each word = binary vector (only one ‘1’, rest ‘0’)
- Dimension = size of vocabulary (could be 100,000!)
- No similarity info: “cat” and “kitten” are as far as “cat” and “car”

#### ✅ Solution: Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec)

Each word → dense vector (say 300 numbers long)

🔑 Key properties:
1. **Similar words cluster together**  
   → cat ≈ kitten, dog ≈ puppy
2. **Analogies become math**  
   → king – man + woman ≈ queen  
   → Paris – France + Italy ≈ Rome

📌 Visual: Imagine words floating in 3D space. Related ones stick together.

🧠 Memory Aid: Think of Google Maps — cities close to each other are similar. “Delhi” near “India”, far from “Brazil”.

---

### ➤ Specialized Word Embeddings in Economics

Researchers tweak embeddings to suit economic needs.

#### 1. **Monetary Policy Word Embeddings**
- Words describing monetary policy evolve over time.
- E.g., “quantitative easing” replaced older terms.
- Embedding tracks changes: W₁ at time t, W₂ at t+1 → if they mean same thing, their vectors should be close.

📌 Purpose: Track how central banks change language to signal policy shifts.

#### 2. **Economic Word Worth Embeddings (WWM)**
- Not only semantic similarity, but also **economic value**.
- Words with similar economic impact → closer in space.

Example:
- “inflation”, “GDP”, “unemployment” → high economic worth
- “umbrella”, “chair” → lower worth (unless context-specific)

🎯 Claim: Better than regular Word2Vec for economic forecasting because it values words by importance, not just meaning.

---

### ➤ Neural Language Models (RNNs, LSTMs)

Like n-grams, but smarter.

Use **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** or **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory):
- Process words one by one
- Maintain a **hidden state (Z)** that captures context
- Final Z predicts next word probability

🧠 Like reading a book slowly, remembering earlier chapters as you go.

Used in chatbots, translation, stock prediction.

---

### ➤ Transformers & Attention (State-of-the-Art since 2017–2018)

Biggest breakthrough: **Attention Mechanism**

#### 🔍 What is Attention?
- Measures **how important each word is** in understanding another word.

📌 Example:
> "The bank closed because of the storm."  
→ “bank” likely means riverbank, not financial bank  
→ Words like “storm”, “closed” give clues → attention links them

🧠 Like highlighting keywords while studying.

#### 🏗️ Transformer Architecture
- Entirely based on attention
- Processes all words at once (faster than RNNs)
- Can learn long-range dependencies

🏆 Famous model: **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

##### What makes BERT special?
- **Bidirectional**: Looks at **both left and right context**  
  → Understands meaning better than models that only read forward
- Pre-trained on massive text, then fine-tuned for tasks

📌 Example:  
“Apple is releasing a new phone.” vs “I ate a red apple.”  
BERT uses full sentence to distinguish brand vs fruit.

---

### ➤ Econ-BERT: BERT for Economics
Custom version of BERT trained/fine-tuned for economic texts.

🎯 Task: **Named Entity Recognition in Economics**

Finds economic concepts like:
1. **Outcomes**: savings, employment, poverty reduction
2. **Interventions**: subsidies, taxes, regulations
3. **Agents**: households, firms, government

📌 Why needed? Regular BERT may not recognize technical economic terms properly.

🔧 Fix: Retrain BERT on economic papers, policy docs, news → becomes expert in econ jargon.

---

## 📈 7. Real-World Applications in Economics (Case Studies)

Now let’s see how these tools are used in actual research.

---

### 🔎 Case Study 1: Using NLP to Read Urban Resilience Plans

📄 Paper: Analyzing 78 resilience plans from the **100 Resilient Cities Network**

🎯 Goal: Help city planners quickly grasp key issues in long policy documents.

🛠️ Tool: **Topic Modeling (LDA)**

✅ Findings:
- Topics discovered automatically matched manual analysis!
- Examples:
  - Disaster Management → risk, hazard, recovery
  - Public Health → wellness, disease, access
  - Energy → power, solar, efficiency

🧠 Benefit:
- Planner interested in energy? Just extract all sentences tagged under “Energy” topic.
- Saves hours of reading entire reports.

🔁 Like creating a table of contents with smart tags.

---

### 🔎 Case Study 2: Inflation Expectations via Internet Search

📄 Paper: *Epidemiology of Inflation Expectations and Internet Search*

🎯 Question: How do people form expectations about inflation?

Traditional view: Through TV, newspapers  
New idea: Through **Google searches**

🛠️ Tools:
- **Google Trends data** → what people search (e.g., “rising prices”, “food cost”)
- **Sentiment Analysis** → Are searches worried or calm?

📅 Period: 2006–2018, India

✅ Findings:
- Internet search behavior correlates with **public inflation expectations**
- People update beliefs slowly → **information stickiness**
- Negative sentiment in searches → higher expected inflation

🧠 Implication: Governments can monitor Google trends to anticipate public concern.

🔁 Like checking pulse of the nation through search queries.

---

### 🔎 Case Study 3: Recommender Systems Using Review Mining

Used by: Amazon, Yelp, TripAdvisor

🎯 Goal: Improve recommendations using user reviews.

🛠️ Approach:
- Extract **aspects** people care about
- Assign **sentiment scores** per aspect

📌 Example Review:
> “I loved the food. Best sweet and sour soup ever! Delivery was good. Staff were nice.”

🔍 System breaks it down:
| Aspect | Sentiment | Score |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Food | Positive (“loved”) | 5 |
| Soup | Extremely positive (“best ever”) | 5 |
| Delivery | Mildly positive (“pretty good”) | 4 |
| Staff (people) | Positive (“nice”) | 4 |

🎯 Business Value:
- User wants hotels with great bathrooms? Show places with highest bathroom sentiment.
- Not just overall rating — **aspect-level insight**.

🔁 Like filtering restaurants by “taste”, “service”, “ambience” separately.

---

### 🔎 Case Study 4: Stock Market Prediction Using News & Social Media

🎯 Can social opinions predict stock prices?

🛠️ Method:
- Collect news headlines and social media posts
- Apply **sentiment analysis**
- Feed sentiment + historical prices into LSTM model

📉 Result:
- Blue dashed line = prediction using price history only → inaccurate
- Red solid line = prediction **with sentiment input** → much closer to real price (black line)

✅ Conclusion: Public sentiment affects markets. Including it improves forecasts.

🔁 Like knowing crowd mood helps predict election results.

---

### 🔎 Case Study 5: Predicting Economic Development Using Wikipedia Articles

🎯 Idea: Combine **text + images** to estimate wealth/development in regions.

Data Sources:
1. **Geolocated Wikipedia Articles**  
   - Pages tagged with GPS coordinates (e.g., “Mysore City”)
   - NLP extracts info: hospitals, schools, industries mentioned
2. **Satellite Imagery (Night Lights)**  
   - Brighter areas = more development (from previous lecture)

🧠 Fusion: **Multimodal AI Model**
- One branch processes text (Wikipedia)
- One branch processes image (satellite night lights)
- Both feed into shared layer → predicts socioeconomic status

🔁 Like combining a city’s Wikipedia page + nighttime photo to guess how rich it is.

🎯 Advantage: Works even where official stats are missing.

---

## 📚 Summary of All Papers Discussed (References Recap)

1. **Urban Resilience Plans** → Topic Modeling → Identify policy themes
2. **Inflation Expectations** → Google Trends + Sentiment → Measure public belief
3. **Recommender Systems** → Aspect-based Sentiment → Better personalization
4. **Stock Market Prediction** → News/Social Sentiment + LSTM → Improved forecasting
5. **Economic Development Prediction** → Geolocated Wikipedia + Satellite Images → Multimodal estimation

---

## 🧠 Final Summary: Why NLP Matters in Economics

| Area | How NLP Helps |
|------|----------------|
| **Policy Analysis** | Automatically extract topics from thousands of reports |
| **Public Opinion** | Track inflation/job expectations via social media |
| **Market Behavior** | Predict stock moves using news sentiment |
| **Development Tracking** | Estimate regional growth using open-source text + images |
| **Customer Insights** | Mine reviews to improve products/services |

🔥 **Key Takeaway**:  
NLP allows economists to scale beyond surveys and spreadsheets. Now they can analyze **millions of documents, tweets, reviews, and policies** — fast, cheap, and insightful.

And with modern tools like **BERT, transformers, and embeddings**, machines are getting closer to truly *understanding* human language — especially when tuned for economics.
