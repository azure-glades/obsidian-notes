### 💬 1. **What is a mechanism?**  
> It’s the **rules of the game**.  
> *Example:* “Highest bid wins, and you pay what you bid.” (First-price auction)  
> Or: “Highest bid wins, but you pay the second-highest bid.” (Vickrey auction)

👉 Think of it like the **rulebook** for an auction.

### 💬 2. **Why design a mechanism?**  
> Because people lie to win or pay less.  
> You want the auction to:  
> - Give the item to the person who values it most ✅  
> - Make the seller earn as much as possible 💰  
> - Stop people from cheating  

So you **design the rules** so that even if everyone acts selfishly, the outcome is still good.

### 💬 3. **What is the social choice function?**  
> It’s your **goal** — what you *want* to happen.  
> Example: “Give the item to the person who values it the most.”  
> That’s it. Just the **ideal result**, before worrying about how to get there.

👉 Like saying: “I want the smartest student to get the scholarship.”  
The mechanism is *how* you pick them — test? interview? lottery?


## **Revelation Principle**
If some mechanism makes people play complicated strategies in equilibrium, then you could instead design a _direct_ mechanism where people just report their true values, and the mechanism itself reproduces the same outcome.
	- A social choice function is implementable by a direct mechanism if it can be implemented through an indirect mechanism

## **Gibbard–Satterthwaite Theorem**
the only way to stop people from lying is if one person gets to decide everything alone — otherwise, someone can always cheat.

> The **only** way to make sure **no one can ever gain from lying** is to make their input meaningless.”

That’s not idealism — it’s **mathematical inevitability**.
It’s like saying:

> “The only way to guarantee no one can hack your computer is to turn it off.”

You stop manipulation… by removing all power to influence the outcome.

Basically -> If you want a mechanism where truth-telling is dominant, make one person the dictator (so their dominant strat is to be truthful) and the others dont matter.
