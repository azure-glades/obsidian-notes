Certainly! Here's a **simple, clear, and complete explanation** of everything discussed in the transcript — with **no information omitted**, explained in everyday language so anyone can understand.

### 🌟 **Lecture 8: Heuristic Search in Artificial Intelligence for Economics**

#### 👋 Introduction by Professor Adyay Mithro
The professor starts by welcoming everyone to Lecture 8 of the course *“Artificial Intelligence for Economics.”* So far, in Lectures 6 and 7, they talked about **optimization** — like finding the best way to distribute resources (money, time, etc.) to get the best result (like maximum profit or minimum cost). 

Now, in this lecture, they shift focus slightly. Instead of just optimizing one big decision at once, they talk about **sequential decision-making**: making small changes step-by-step over time to reach a good outcome. This is very common in economics — especially when we don’t know everything upfront.

---

### 🧩 The Problem: Sequential Decisions in Complex Systems

Imagine you’re managing an economy with many sectors — like healthcare, education, agriculture, transport. You’ve given some money to each sector right now. That’s your **current state**.

You’re not happy with how things are going. You want to reach a **goal state** — maybe where every sector is producing enough output to meet minimum needs. But you don’t know exactly how to get there.

So what do you do?

> ✅ You start from your current situation.  
> ✅ You make small changes — like moving $10 million from education to healthcare.  
> ✅ Then you see if things improved.  
> ✅ Then you make another small change.  
> ✅ Keep doing this until you reach your goal.

This is like walking through a maze blindfolded — you can only see the next few steps ahead, not the whole map.

This kind of problem is called a **search problem** — and it’s modeled using something called a **graph**.

---

### 🗺️ What Is a Graph?

A **graph** is just a picture made of:

- **Vertices (or nodes)**: These are dots representing different **states** of the system.  
  → Example: One node = “I gave $50M to healthcare, $30M to education, $20M to transport.”

- **Edges (or links)**: These are lines connecting two nodes. They show **possible moves** from one state to another.  
  → Example: From “State A” (giving $50M to healthcare), I can move to “State B” by shifting $10M to education. There’s an edge between them.

Important notes:
- Some graphs have **directions** on edges → called **directed graphs**.  
  → If there’s an arrow from A to B, you can go A→B, but NOT B→A unless there’s another arrow.
- Other graphs have **no directions** → called **undirected graphs**.  
  → If A and B are connected, you can go both ways.

#### 🔗 Path
A **path** is a sequence of connected edges that takes you from one node to another.

Example:  
If you want to go from Node A to Node C, but there’s no direct edge, you might go:  
**A → D → E → C**  
That’s a path with 3 steps.

#### 🔄 Connected Graph
If you can find a path between **every pair of nodes**, the graph is called **connected**.

### 🔍 Graph Search: Finding Your Way

Now imagine you’re stuck at Node A. You want to reach any of the “goal” nodes (say G or H). But you don’t know the whole map!

There are classic ways to search:

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:  
   → Look at all neighbors of A first.  
   → Then look at all neighbors of those neighbors.  
   → Like spreading out in circles. Always checks nearby points before going far.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:  
   → Pick one neighbor of A, go as deep as possible down that path.  
   → Only backtrack if you hit a dead end.

These work well if you know the **whole graph** — all nodes and edges — ahead of time.

But in real life? **You rarely know the full map.**

---

### 📏 Weighted Graphs and Shortest Paths

Sometimes, each edge has a **weight** — a number showing the **cost** of moving along that edge.

Example:  
Moving from State A to State B costs $5 million in lost productivity.  
Moving from B to C costs $3 million.  

Then the total cost of path A→B→C = 5 + 3 = **8 million**.

We want the **shortest path** — the path with the least total cost — from Start to Goal.

Classic algorithms for this:
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: Finds shortest path from one point to all others.
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: Finds shortest paths between ALL pairs of points.

✅ These algorithms are **perfect** — they always find the true shortest path...  
❌ **BUT** — they need you to know the ENTIRE GRAPH in advance.

---

### ❗ The Big Problem: We Don’t Know the Full Map!

In real-world economics, you often **don’t know**:
- How many possible states there are.
- Which states connect to which.
- What the exact costs are for every move.

Examples:
- **Chess**: At any moment, you can make legal moves (e.g., move pawn forward). But there are trillions of possible future board positions. You can’t list them all!
- **Economic Policy (e.g., during COVID)**: Should we lock down? Open schools? Give stimulus? Each choice leads to unknown long-term outcomes. We can only guess short-term effects.
- **Supply Chain**: If I change my supplier in Vietnam, what happens to delivery time 3 months later? I don’t know — but I can try it and see next week.
- **Portfolio Investment**: Should I sell stock X and buy stock Y today? I can estimate tomorrow’s gain/loss, but not the result after 10 trades.

So we need a smarter way — one that works **without knowing the whole map**.

### 🧠 Enter: Heuristic Search

This is where **heuristic search** comes in.

> 🔑 **Heuristic** = A smart guess or rule-of-thumb.

Instead of exploring blindly, we use a **heuristic function** to estimate:
> “How far am I from my goal?”

Let’s define three key terms:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **g(x)** | Cost to reach current node `x` from the start. (What you’ve already spent) |
| **h(x)** | Estimated cost from current node `x` to the goal. (Your guess) |
| **f(x)** | Total estimated cost: **f(x) = g(x) + h(x)** |

👉 Think of it like driving to Mumbai:
- `g(x)` = How many kilometers you’ve already driven.
- `h(x)` = Your GPS says “You’re 100 km away.”
- `f(x)` = Total estimated trip length = 200 km (already driven) + 100 km (left) = 300 km.

You pick the path with the **lowest f(x)** — because it looks cheapest overall.

---

### ⭐ The A* (A-Star) Algorithm

This is the most famous heuristic search algorithm.

#### ✅ How A* Works Step-by-Step (Using the Example in the Lecture)

We have:
- Start node: **A**
- Goal nodes: **G** and **H** (any one is fine)
- Each node has a **heuristic value h(x)** — your guess of distance to goal.
- Edges have weights — actual costs to move.

We maintain two lists:
- **Open List**: Nodes we’ve seen, but haven’t explored yet.
- **Closed List**: Nodes we’ve fully explored.

#### Step 1: Start at A
- Neighbors of A: **C** and **D**
- Cost to reach C from A = 2 → so `g(C) = 2`
- Cost to reach D from A = 5 → so `g(D) = 5`
- Heuristics (guesses): `h(C)=5`, `h(D)=1`

So:
- `f(C) = g(C) + h(C) = 2 + 5 = 7`
- `f(D) = 5 + 1 = 6`

→ Choose the one with **lowest f(x)** → **D** (6 < 7)

Move to D. Add D to closed list.

#### Step 2: From D
Neighbors of D: Only **E**
- Cost from A→D→E = 5 (A→D) + 1 (D→E) = 6 → `g(E) = 6`
- Heuristic of E: `h(E) = 1`
- So `f(E) = 6 + 1 = 7`

Add E to open list.

Current open list: C (f=7), E (f=7)

Pick one arbitrarily (tie-breaker). Let’s pick **C**.

#### Step 3: From C
Neighbors: A (already visited), E (in open list), F, B

New nodes: F and B

Calculate their values:
- To reach F via C: `g(F) = g(C) + cost(C→F) = 2 + 4 = 6`
- `h(F) = 3` → `f(F) = 6 + 3 = 9`
- To reach B via C: `g(B) = 2 + 5 = 7`, `h(B) = 9` → `f(B) = 16`

Wait — correction from transcript: In the example, `h(F) = 3`, but then `f(F) = 9`, and `h(B) = 9`, so `f(B) = 7+9=16`?  
Actually, in the video, the numbers were adjusted later — but the idea remains: **we calculate f(x) for new nodes**.

Now open list has: E (f=7), F (f=9), B (f=16)

→ Pick E (lowest f=7)

#### Step 4: From E
Neighbors: C (visited), D (visited), F, G, H

New nodes: G and H

- Reach G via E: `g(G) = g(E) + cost(E→G) = 6 + 2 = 8`, `h(G) = 0` (it’s a goal!) → `f(G) = 8 + 0 = 8`
- Reach H via E: `g(H) = 6 + 4 = 10`, `h(H) = 0` → `f(H) = 10`

Now open list: F (9), B (16), G (8), H (10)

→ Lowest f(x) is **G (8)** → GOAL REACHED!

✅ Path found: **A → D → E → G**, total cost = 8

Note: There’s another path A→C→E→G also costing 8, but A* picked the first one it found with lowest f(x).

---

### ⚠️ Critical Rule: Heuristic Must Be **Admissible**

This is the MOST IMPORTANT part.

> 🔒 **Admissible Heuristic**: Your guess `h(x)` must **never overestimate** the true cost to reach the goal.

Why?

Because if you **overestimate**, A* might ignore the real shortest path!

#### 💥 Example of Failure (from transcript):

Suppose:
- True cost from D to goal G: D→E→G = 1 + 2 = **3**
- But you guessed `h(D) = 10` (way too high!)

Then:
- `f(D) = g(D) + h(D) = 5 + 10 = 15`
- Meanwhile, `f(C) = 7` → So A* picks C instead of D

Eventually, A* finds path A→C→F→H with cost 9, thinking it’s best.

But the real shortest path was A→D→E→G = 8!

➡️ Because you overestimated `h(D)`, A* ignored D entirely → **Missed the optimal solution!**

✅ So: **Always underestimate or be accurate** — never overestimate.

#### ✅ Safe Heuristic Tip:
A simple, safe way to pick `h(x)`:
> Take the **minimum cost to any neighbor** of node x.

Example: From D, neighbors are A (cost 5) and E (cost 1).  
→ Minimum = 1 → Use `h(D) = 1`

Why is this safe?
- Because to reach the goal from D, you must go through at least one neighbor.
- Even if that neighbor is 1 unit away, you still need more steps after that → so true cost ≥ 1.
- So guessing 1 **underestimates** → admissible → guaranteed to find optimal path!

### 🏛️ Why Does This Matter in Economics?

Professor Mithro gives **real economic examples**:

#### 1. **Pandemic Policy (COVID)**
- Should we lock down? Open borders? Give cash handouts?
- We can’t predict what will happen in 6 months.
- But we can guess: “If I lock down this week, unemployment might rise 2% next month.”
- We make small decisions, observe results, adjust — just like heuristic search.

#### 2. **Supply Chain Optimization**
- Company wants to minimize shipping costs.
- Can’t model every possible supplier, delay, weather event, strike.
- But if I switch suppliers in India today, I can see next week’s delivery time.
- Use heuristic: “This supplier feels faster” → test it → adapt.

#### 3. **Portfolio Investment**
- You have $100K to invest in stocks.
- You don’t know which stock will boom in 2 years.
- Today: You sell Stock X (low growth), buy Stock Y (seems promising).
- Next week: Re-evaluate. Did Y go up? Then buy more. If not, try Z.
- You explore step-by-step, using heuristics like “stocks with rising volume seem good.”

→ In all cases:  
You don’t know the full “map” of possibilities.  
You can only see **immediate next steps**.  
You use **smart guesses (heuristics)** to choose the best-looking next move.  
→ That’s **heuristic search** in action!

### 🎯 Summary: Everything Covered (No Information Omitted!)

| Topic | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| **Optimization vs. Search** | Earlier lectures: optimize one big decision. Now: make small, sequential changes. |
| **Graph Basics** | Nodes = states, Edges = possible moves. Directed = one-way, Undirected = both ways. |
| **Path** | Sequence of edges from one node to another. |
| **Connected Graph** | Every node can be reached from every other node. |
| **Weighted Graph** | Edges have costs (e.g., money, time, risk). |
| **Shortest Path Algorithms** | Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall — perfect, but need full map. |
| **Problem with Full Maps** | Real economies are too complex. We don’t know all states or transitions. |
| **Heuristic Search** | Use smart guesses (`h(x)`) to guide search without full knowledge. |
| **g(x)** | Actual cost from start to current node. |
| **h(x)** | Estimated cost from current node to goal (a guess!). |
| **f(x)** | Total estimated cost: `f(x) = g(x) + h(x)` |
| **A* Algorithm** | Always pick the node with lowest `f(x)` to explore next. |
| **Open/Closed Lists** | Open = nodes to explore; Closed = nodes already explored. |
| **Admissibility** | `h(x)` must NEVER overestimate true cost to goal. Otherwise, A* fails. |
| **Safe Heuristic Trick** | Set `h(x)` = minimum cost to any neighbor → always underestimates → safe. |
| **Failure Case** | Overestimating `h(D) = 10` caused A* to miss true shortest path A→D→E→G (cost 8) and pick wrong path A→C→F→H (cost 9). |
| **Economic Applications** | COVID policy, supply chains, portfolio investment — all involve stepping forward with limited foresight, using heuristics to guide choices. |

### 💬 Final Thought (Professor’s Message)

> In economics, we rarely have perfect information.  
> We can’t solve everything with one big equation.  
> Instead, we act, observe, adjust — step by step.  
> Heuristic search like A* gives us a **mathematical framework** to do exactly that.  
> It turns messy, uncertain decision-making into a structured, intelligent process.

### ✅ Conclusion

This lecture taught us that:
- Many economic problems are **not one-time optimizations**, but **long sequences of small decisions**.
- We model these as **graphs**, where each state is a node and each action is an edge.
- When we don’t know the whole map, we use **heuristic search** — especially **A*** — to find good paths.
- The secret sauce is the **heuristic function `h(x)`**: it must be **admissible** (never overestimate).
- Real-world examples: pandemic response, supply chains, investing — all rely on this logic.
- A* doesn’t guarantee perfection if the guess is bad — but if the guess is safe, it guarantees the **best possible answer**.

### 🙋‍♂️ What’s Next?

In the next lecture, they’ll continue exploring heuristic search — maybe deeper algorithms like Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, or Genetic Algorithms — all used in economics for complex, uncertain problems.
