### Mechanism Design: Groves' Theorem and Quasi-Linear Settings

This lecture delves into **mechanism design** by exploring the **quasi-linear setting**, a special assumption about the structure of outcomes and utility functions that allows for the creation of desirable mechanisms. It culminates in the proof of **Groves' Theorem**, which identifies a class of social choice functions that are dominant strategy incentive compatible (DSIC).

### 1. The Quasi-Linear Setting

The lecture introduces a specific set of assumptions to bypass the negative results of the Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem.

* **Outcome Structure:** The outcome set, $X$, is a tuple of an **allocation** ($k$) and a vector of **payments** ($t_1, \dots, t_n$).
    * The sum of payments, $\sum t_i$, must be less than or equal to zero, meaning the mechanism does not require external funding.
* **Utility Structure:** A player's utility is the sum of their **valuation** for the allocation and the **payment they receive**.
    * $U_i(x, \theta_i) = V_i(k, \theta_i) + t_i$
    * $V_i(k, \theta_i)$ is player $i$'s private valuation for the allocation $k$, which depends only on their type $\theta_i$.
    * $t_i$ is the payment received by player $i$.


> [!NOTE] Quasi Linear Setting
> A **quasi-linear setting** is a specific set of assumptions about how a game is structured, particularly in economics. It's a theoretical framework that simplifies a problem by assuming that players' preferences have a special, predictable form.
> Here's what makes a setting quasi-linear:
> - **The Outcome:** An outcome is not just a decision, but a combination of a **non-monetary allocation** (like who gets an item) and a **monetary transfer** (who pays what).
> - **The Utility Function:** A player's utility is the simple sum of their **valuation** for the allocation and the **payment** they receive. Money is treated as a linear addition to their valuation.

### 2. Allocative Efficiency

* **Definition:** An allocation rule is called **allocatively efficient** if, for every possible profile of players' types, it selects the allocation that maximizes the sum of all players' valuations.
* **Goal:** A social choice function is considered allocatively efficient if its allocation rule is allocatively efficient. This means it aims to achieve the greatest total value for the group.

> [!NOTE] Allocative Function
> An **allocative function** is a rule that determines how resources or goods are distributed among a group of people. 🗳️ It's a central component of a **social choice function** in mechanism design.
> The function takes as input the preferences (or "types") of all players and outputs a specific allocation. For example, in an auction, the allocative function's output would be which bidder gets the item.
> 

Imagine you have three friends and three different prizes (a book, a game, and a gift card). Each friend values the prizes differently.
- Friend 1 values the book at $20, the game at $50, and the gift card at $10.
- Friend 2 values the book at $10, the game at $20, and the gift card at $50.
- Friend 3 values the book at $50, the game at $10, and the gift card at $20.
An **allocatively efficient function** would figure out the best way to distribute the prizes to maximize the total value. In this case, it would give the book to Friend 3, the game to Friend 1, and the gift card to Friend 2.
The **sum of valuations** would be: $50 (Friend 3's book) + $50 (Friend 1's game) + $50 (Friend 2's gift card) = $150. This is the highest possible total value for the group.

### 3. Groves' Theorem

Groves' theorem provides a powerful positive result in mechanism design.

* **Theorem:** A social choice function, $F = (K, T_1, \dots, T_n)$, is **Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatible (DSIC)** if its allocation rule is **allocatively efficient** and its payment functions satisfy a specific structure.
* **Groves' Payment Rule Structure:** The payment to player $i$, $T_i$, is defined as:
    $T_i(\theta) = \sum_{j \neq i} V_j(K(\theta), \theta_j) + h_i(\theta_{-i})$
    * This means player $i$'s payment is determined by the sum of **all other players' valuations** for the chosen allocation, plus an arbitrary function ($h_i$) of the other players' types.

---

### 4. Proof of Groves' Theorem

The proof uses a **proof by contradiction** to demonstrate that the Groves' payment rule makes truthful reporting a dominant strategy.

* **Assumption:** Assume the social choice function is *not* DSIC. This means there exists a player $i$ who can benefit from misreporting their true type $\theta_i$ as $\theta'_i$.
* **The Contradiction:**
    * The utility from misreporting is strictly greater than the utility from truthful reporting.
    * By substituting the quasi-linear utility and Groves' payment functions into this inequality, we can show that the sum of all players' valuations is greater for the allocation chosen from the misreported type profile ($\theta'_i$) than for the one chosen from the true type profile ($\theta_i$).
    * This directly **contradicts the definition of allocative efficiency**, which states that the allocation rule should always maximize the sum of valuations for the true type profile.
* **Conclusion:** The initial assumption that the social choice function is not DSIC must be false. Therefore, any social choice function with an allocatively efficient rule and Groves' payment structure is indeed DSIC.

### 5. Implications and Future Topics

* **Groves' Mechanisms:** Social choice functions that satisfy Groves' theorem are called **Groves' mechanisms**.
* **Truthful Implementation:** Groves' payment rules provide a way to implement any allocatively efficient allocation rule in a dominant strategy equilibrium, which is the most desirable form of incentive compatibility.
* **Next Steps:** The lecture concludes by mentioning that future lectures will explore specific types of Groves' mechanisms, such as the **Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)** or **Clarke Mechanism**.

### Keywords and Definitions

* **Quasi-Linear Setting:** A theoretical framework where the outcome includes both an allocation and payments, and a player's utility is the sum of their valuation and their payment.
* **Allocative Efficiency:** "An allocation rule is called allocatively efficient if for all type profiles, it picks the allocation that maximizes the sum of all players' valuations."
* **Groves' Theorem:** "A theorem stating that an allocatively efficient social choice function is dominant strategy incentive compatible if its payment functions satisfy a specific structure."
* **DSIC (Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatible):** A property where telling the truth is the best strategy for a player, regardless of what others do.
