### 🎓 **Lecture 9: Game Trees, Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Multi-Objective Search in Economics**

#### **1. What is a Game Tree?**
Imagine you’re playing **chess** or **tic-tac-toe**.  
- Two players take turns.  
- One player (say, White) moves first. Then Black. Then White again. And so on.  
- Each player wants to **win**. But if one wins, the other loses. So their goals are **exactly opposite**.  

Now, think of every possible move as a step in a giant **tree-shaped diagram** called a **Game Tree**.

- The **top of the tree** is the starting position of the game (e.g., all pieces in their original spots).  
- From there, each possible move by Player 1 branches out into new positions.  
- From each of those, Player 2 makes their possible moves — more branches.  
- This keeps going until someone wins, loses, or it’s a draw — these end points are called **leaf nodes**.  

So, a **game tree** is just a picture showing:
- All possible moves,
- Who moves when (alternating players),
- And what the final results are (win/lose/draw).

> ✅ **Key idea**: A game tree is not just any graph — it’s a **tree with no cycles**, arranged in **layers (levels)**, where each level belongs to one player.

#### **2. Why is Chess Hard to Play?**
Because:
- After your move, your opponent can respond in many ways.
- Then you respond to each of *their* responses.
- Then they respond to yours… and so on.
- You have to think **many steps ahead** to know if your current move will lead to victory.

But humans can’t imagine all possibilities. Even experts only think 3–5 moves ahead.  
Computers can do more — but even they get overwhelmed because chess has **trillions** of possible paths!

That’s why we need smart algorithms to help us find the best move without checking *every* possibility.

---

#### **3. Heuristic Function in Games (Estimating “Goodness”)**
In regular pathfinding (like finding the shortest route), we use a **heuristic function** — an estimate of how close we are to the goal.

In games, we do something similar:
- We assign a **score** to each board position (node).
- This score tells us: **“How good is this position for me?”**

We set a rule:
- For **Player 1 (P1)** → Lower score = better (they want to **minimize** the score).
- For **Player 2 (P2)** → Higher score = better (they want to **maximize** the score).

Example:
- If P1 sees three options with scores: 6, 9, 7 → They pick **6** (lowest).
- If P2 sees two options with scores: 2 and 8 → They pick **8** (highest).

This score is just an **estimate** — like guessing how far you are from the finish line without knowing the full path.

---

#### **4. The Minimax Algorithm — Finding the Best Move**
Now, here’s the big idea: **What if we could calculate the true “best” value for every node in the game tree?**

We do this using the **Minimax algorithm**.

It works **bottom-up** — starting from the end of the game (leaf nodes) and working back to the start.

##### How Minimax Works:
- At **leaf nodes** (end positions), we already know the result: e.g., 0 = P1 wins, 8 = P2 wins.
- Now go one level up:
  - If it’s **P2’s turn** at that node → Pick the **maximum** value among its children (because P2 wants to maximize).
  - If it’s **P1’s turn** at that node → Pick the **minimum** value among its children (because P1 wants to minimize).

##### Example:
Let’s say we have:

```
          [P1's turn]
         /    |    \
       [P2]   [P2]  [P2]
      /  \    / \    |
    [0] [8] [8] [1] [8]
```

- Bottom layer (leaf nodes): values are 0, 8, 8, 1, 8.
- Go up to P2’s nodes:
  - First P2 node: children are 0 and 8 → P2 picks **8** (max)
  - Second P2 node: children are 8 and 1 → P2 picks **8** (max)
  - Third P2 node: only child is 8 → stays **8**
- Now back to top (P1’s turn): children are 8, 8, 8 → P1 picks **8**? Wait — no!

Wait — P1 wants to **minimize**. So among 8, 8, 8 → they pick **8**.

But earlier we thought P1 might win with 0? Let’s fix the example.

Actually, let’s say the real structure was:

```
          [P1's turn]
         /    |    \
       [P2]   [P2]  [P2]
      /  \    / \    |
    [0] [8] [8] [1] [8]
```

After applying minimax:

- First P2 node → max(0,8) = **8**
- Second P2 node → max(8,1) = **8**
- Third P2 node → max(8) = **8**

Now P1 chooses min(8,8,8) = **8**

But wait — that means P1 gets 8, which is bad for them? Yes! That suggests P1 is doomed.

But now look: What if one branch had a 0?

Suppose instead:

```
          [P1's turn]
         /    |    \
       [P2]   [P2]  [P2]
      /  \    / \    |
    [0] [1] [4] [8] [0]
```

Apply minimax:

- First P2 → max(0,1) = **1**
- Second P2 → max(4,8) = **8**
- Third P2 → max(0) = **0**

Now P1 chooses min(1, 8, 0) = **0**

→ So P1 should choose the **third branch**, because it leads to a final result of **0**, which is best for them.

✅ So Minimax lets us **pretend both players play perfectly** and then figure out:  
> “If I make this move, and my opponent plays their best, and I respond with my best, and so on — what’s the final outcome?”

And we pick the move that gives us the **best guaranteed result**, assuming worst-case opponent behavior.

#### **5. Alpha-Beta Pruning — Making Minimax Faster**
Minimax checks **every single path**. That’s slow.

**Alpha-Beta Pruning** is a trick to **skip parts of the tree** that don’t matter.

##### How?
Imagine you’re climbing up the tree, calculating values.

You keep track of two numbers:
- **Alpha (α)**: Best value P1 (minimizer) can guarantee so far.
- **Beta (β)**: Best value P2 (maximizer) can guarantee so far.

When α ≥ β → **Stop!** You can prune (ignore) the rest of that branch.

##### Simple Example:
Say you’re evaluating a P2 node (wants max). You’ve seen one child with value **5**. So current β = 5.

Now you look at the next child. Its first grandchild is **6**.  
→ Since this is a P2 node, 6 > 5 → So this branch might give a higher value than 5.

BUT — suppose the next grandchild under this same P2 node is **3**.  
→ Then the P2 node’s value would be max(6,3) = 6 → still better than 5.

Now imagine another branch under the same P2 node — and you see its first child is **7**.  
→ Already 7 > 5 → So even before checking other children, you know this whole branch will give ≥7, which is worse for P1.

But wait — P1 is above this P2 node. P1 wants to **minimize**. So if P1 already has a path that guarantees **5**, and now you’re seeing a P2 node that can force a result of **7 or higher**, then **P1 will never choose this path**.

So you can **cut off (prune)** the entire subtree under this P2 node — no need to check the rest!

This is called **Beta Pruning** (pruning branches that are too high for P1).

Similarly, if you’re at a P1 node (minimizing), and you already found a path that gives 3, and now you see a child that leads to 4, and then you see another child whose first grandchild is 5 — you know this branch will be ≥5, which is worse than 3 → so you can **prune** it. This is **Alpha Pruning**.

✅ **Alpha-Beta Pruning** doesn’t change the result — it just makes the algorithm **much faster** by skipping useless branches.

#### **6. Multi-Objective Heuristic Search (Extending A\* to Multiple Goals)**
In normal pathfinding (like A\*), we minimize **one thing**: total distance.

But in real life, we often have **multiple goals** at once.

Example: Driving from Delhi to Mumbai.
- You want to minimize:
  1. Time
  2. Cost (fuel + tolls)
  3. Pollution

These are **three different things**. You can’t just add them up easily.

So we represent cost as a **vector**:  
→ (time, cost, pollution) = (3 hrs, ₹1000, 20 kg CO₂)

Now, in A\*, we used f(n) = g(n) + h(n)  
→ Now, **g(n)** and **h(n)** become **vectors**, so **f(n)** becomes a vector too.

Problem:  
How do you choose between two paths with vectors:  
- Path A: (5, 3, 8)  
- Path B: (3, 5, 7)

Which is better?  
- A has less cost (3 vs 5) but more time (5 vs 3) and more pollution (8 vs 7).  
→ Neither dominates the other.  
→ So we call them **non-dominated**.

But now consider Path C: (6, 6, 9)  
→ Every number is worse than A and B → So C is **dominated**. We can ignore it.

So in **Multi-Objective A\***:
- We don’t pick the *single best* path.
- We keep a list of **non-dominated paths** (the “Pareto front”).
- We expand the ones that might lead to better results later.
- We **never close** a non-dominated node — because it might become useful later.

✅ So instead of one optimal path, we get a **set of good options** — and the user picks based on preference.

Example from lecture:
- Node n1: heuristic = {(2,3), (3,2)} — two options, neither dominates the other.
- Node n2: heuristic = {(3,2)} — only one option.
- So we keep both (2,3) and (3,2) for n1, and compare f-values accordingly.

Even if f(n1) gives two possible values: (5,5) and (4,6), we keep both until we’re sure one is dominated.

---

#### **7. Multi-Objective Game Trees (Extending Minimax to Multiple Goals)**
Same idea — but now applied to games.

Instead of single scores like 0, 8, etc., each node has a **vector score**:

Example:  
P2 (maximizer) has three choices:  
- Option 1: (11, 5)  
- Option 2: (9, 4)  
- Option 3: (7, 3)

Now, (11,5) dominates (9,4) and (7,3) because 11 > 9 and 5 > 4, and 11 > 7 and 5 > 3.  
→ So P2 picks **(11,5)**.

But if options were:  
- (11,5)  
- (5,7)

Now:  
- (11,5) has higher first value but lower second.  
- (5,7) has lower first but higher second.  
→ Neither dominates the other → So both are kept as possible choices.

For P1 (minimizer):  
Options:  
- (7,3)  
- (5,7)

Here, (7,3) dominates (5,7)? No.  
But (7,3) has higher first, lower second.  
→ Again, non-dominated → Both kept.

So the game tree now stores **sets of vectors** at each node, not single numbers.

The minimax logic still applies:
- At P2’s turn → pick the **best (max) non-dominated vectors** from children.
- At P1’s turn → pick the **best (min) non-dominated vectors** from children.

And alpha-beta pruning can still be adapted — but it’s more complex because now you’re comparing sets of vectors.

#### **8. Why Does This Matter in Economics?**
All of this isn’t just for games — it’s super important in economics!

##### 🔹 Game Trees Model Market Competition
Think of companies in a market:
- Company A lowers prices → Company B reacts by advertising more → Company A responds by launching a new product.
- Each move affects profits, market share, customer loyalty.

Each company is a **player**.  
Each decision is a **move**.  
Each outcome (profit, loss, market dominance) is a **score**.

So we model the entire market interaction as a **game tree** — and use minimax to predict what rational companies will do.

##### 🔹 Behavioral Economics
Predict how people behave in negotiations:
- Should I accept $50 now or wait for $100 later?
- Will the buyer bluff? Will the seller hold firm?

Game trees help model these strategic decisions — and predict outcomes based on rational self-interest.

##### 🔹 Multi-Objective Policy Making (Macro Economics)
Central banks (like RBI or Fed) don’t just care about one thing.

They must balance:
- Low inflation
- Low unemployment
- Stable exchange rates
- Economic growth

These goals often **conflict**:
- Lowering interest rates boosts jobs → but may cause inflation.
- Raising rates fights inflation → but causes layoffs.

So policy makers face a **multi-objective optimization problem**.

Just like in multi-objective A\*, they don’t pick one “best” policy — they look at a **set of non-dominated policies** (trade-offs):

> “Option A: Inflation 4%, Unemployment 5%”  
> “Option B: Inflation 3%, Unemployment 7%”

Neither is clearly better — so policymakers choose based on public priorities.

This is exactly what multi-objective search models — and it’s used in real economic planning.

### 💡 Final Thought
This lecture connects **AI search techniques** (from computer science) to **real economic problems**.  
We didn’t just learn how computers play chess — we learned how to model **human competition**, **strategic decisions**, and **complex trade-offs** in markets and policies.

Next lecture (Lecture 10) shifts to **machine learning** — but today, we mastered **how intelligent agents reason under opposition and multiple goals** — and why that matters for economies.
