### ✅ **Pairwise Stability** (used in network formation):
- Focuses on _individual incentives_ to form or delete _one link at a time_.
- A network is pairwise stable if:
    1. **No one wants to break** an existing link (on their own).
    2. **No two people both want to add** a new link (mutual benefit required).
- It’s about _stability through small, bilateral changes_.
➡️ _“Nobody wants to change anything, given what others are doing.”_

### ✅ **Pareto Efficiency** (a general economics concept):
- A situation is Pareto efficient if you **can’t make anyone better off without making someone else worse off**.
- It’s about _total group welfare_ — not stability or incentives.
- A network can be Pareto efficient even if nobody is happy with it — as long as improving one person’s payoff hurts someone else.
➡️ _“No better deal exists for the group without hurting at least one person.”_

### 🍕 Real-life analogy:

Imagine you and two friends are splitting a pizza.

- **Pareto efficient**: You’ve sliced it so no one can get more without someone else getting less. Maybe one person got a huge slice — but you _can’t improve_ it without hurting someone.
- **Pairwise stable**: No two of you want to swap slices, and no one wants to give up their slice. Even if the split is unfair — you’re all “stuck” because no _mutual deal_ makes both sides better off.

➡️ So: The outcome might be _stable_ (no one moves), but not _fair or efficient_.  
Or _efficient_ (best total happiness), but _unstable_ (someone will rebel!).
