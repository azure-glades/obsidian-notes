General Groves payment looks like:

$$p_i = h_i(v_{-i}) - \sum_{j \neq i} v_j(x^*)$$

- $x∗x^*$ = the welfare-maximizing outcome given everyone’s reports.
    
- $vj(x∗)v_j(x^*)$ = how much value player jj gets from that outcome.
    
- $hi(⋅)h_i(\cdot)$ = some function that depends only on others’ reports, not ii’s. That’s the “adjustment.”
    

Clarke sets

$$h_i(v_{−i})= \max_{x} \sum_{j \neq i} v_j(x)$$

—that is, the best welfare the others could achieve if you weren’t around.

	So your payment becomes:

$$p_i = \big(\text{best the others could do without you}\big) - \big(\text{what the others actually get with you}\big).$$

That’s exactly the externality picture you already had.

Want me to contrast what happens if you pick a _different_ hih_i than Clarke’s?
