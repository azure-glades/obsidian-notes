### 🌟 **Course Overview & Speaker Introduction**
- The speaker is **Addoi Mitro**, an assistant professor at **IIT Kharagpur**.
- This is the **final lecture** of a course on **Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Economics**.
- The main topics covered today are:
  1. **Ethics in AI/ML**
  2. **Bias and Fairness**
  3. **Interpretability (Explainable AI)**
  4. **Environmental impact of AI → Green AI**

Let’s go through each topic step by step.

## 🔹 1. **Ethics in Machine Learning (AI Ethics)**

### What is Ethics in AI?
> "Just because we *can* do something with AI doesn’t mean we *should*."

Ethics means making sure that AI systems are used **responsibly, fairly, and safely**, especially when they affect people’s lives.

There are **two major areas where ethical issues arise**:

---

### ✅ A. **Ethical Issues in Data Collection**
- ML models need **a lot of data** to work well → “data-hungry”.
- But collecting too much data from people without their permission or for wrong purposes creates **privacy problems**.
  
#### Example:
Imagine a recommendation system (like YouTube or Amazon). It works better if it knows your habits, likes, and personal info. But would you feel comfortable if this data was shared with others? Probably not!

👉 So, even if AI improves service, **violating privacy is unethical**.

---

### ✅ B. **AI in High-Stakes Decisions**
Some AI decisions can have **serious real-world consequences**.

Even the best AI models make mistakes — no model is 100% accurate.

#### Examples of high-risk applications:
| Application | Risk if AI makes a mistake |
|------------|----------------------------|
| **Autonomous vehicles (self-driving cars)** | Wrong decision → accident/crash |
| **Policing / Judicial systems** | Innocent person jailed due to wrong prediction |
| **Hiring systems** | Qualified person rejected unfairly |

👉 These are **critical decisions** – ethics must be considered before deploying AI here.

---

### ✅ Key Ethical Guidelines
To avoid harm, follow these principles:

1. ❌ **Avoid using sensitive attributes** like gender, race, religion in predictions.
2. ✅ Use **probabilistic predictions with uncertainty estimates**: If the AI is unsure, it should say: *"I’m not confident about this."*
3. 👤 Always keep a **human in the loop**: Let humans review critical AI decisions.
   - E.g., A doctor checks AI diagnosis before treatment.
4. 🔁 Do **regular testing and updates** of models to fix errors over time.

📌 **Remember:** AI should assist humans, not replace them completely in life-changing decisions.

---

## 🔹 2. **Bias and Fairness in AI**

### What is Bias?
> When an AI system treats some groups of people **unfairly**, often because it learned from biased historical data.

Even if the algorithm itself seems neutral, the **data it learns from may be unfair**, and the AI repeats those injustices.

---

### 🚩 Why Does Bias Happen?

Three main reasons:
1. **Biased training data** → Past data reflects past discrimination.
2. **Flawed assumptions during design** → Developers unknowingly build bias into the system.
3. **Correlation between features and protected attributes** → Even if gender isn’t directly used, other factors (e.g., name, address, job history) might indirectly reveal it.

---

### 🧠 Real-Life Examples of Bias

#### 🔸 Example 1: Hiring System Using Decision Trees
- Company uses AI to shortlist job applicants.
- Historically, only men were hired for certain roles.
- AI learns: “Men get hired more” → starts rejecting women automatically.
- Even though AI didn’t see gender directly, it picked up patterns linked to gender.
- Result: **Gender bias is reinforced.**

👉 AI didn't create the bias — it just **learned and repeated** human bias from old data.

#### 🔸 Example 2: Vaccine Distribution System
- AI predicts who needs vaccines most urgently.
- Trained on past  mostly rich people bought vaccines earlier.
- AI assumes wealth = urgency.
- So now, poor but high-risk people are ignored.

👉 Again, AI **perpetuates existing inequality** because the training data was biased.

📌 **Key Insight:** AI models are only as fair as the data they’re trained on.

---

### ⚖️ How Do We Measure Fairness?

We use statistical methods to check if a model is biased.

Let’s define:
- `R` = AI’s prediction (e.g., hire/don’t hire)
- `Y` = True outcome (should be hired?)
- `A` = Protected attribute (e.g., gender, race)

We don’t want the AI’s decision (`R`) to depend on `A`.

Here are two fairness tests:

---

#### ✅ Test 1: **Independence (Demographic Parity)**
Check if:
> P(R | A=Male) ≈ P(R | A=Female)

If the probability of being hired depends on gender → **bias exists**.

Example: 80% of men get hired vs. only 30% of women → Not fair.

---

#### ✅ Test 2: **Separation (Equal Opportunity)**
Now include the true label `Y`. Check if:
> P(R=1 | Y=1, A=Male) ≈ P(R=1 | Y=1, A=Female)

This means: Among qualified candidates, does everyone have equal chance of being selected?

If women who *should* be hired are less likely to be recommended than equally qualified men → **bias!**

Also check false positives:
> P(R=1 | Y=0, A=Male) ≈ P(R=1 | Y=0, A=Female)

If unqualified men are wrongly approved more than unqualified women → still unfair.

📌 Think: Is the error rate the same across groups?

---

### 🛠️ How to Fix Bias?

#### Step 1: **Detect Bias**
Use the above statistical tests to find out which group is treated unfairly.

#### Step 2: **Mitigate Bias**

##### ➤ Method 1: Improve Training Data
- Collect **more diverse, representative, and balanced data**.
- If past data is biased, fix it:
  - Remove skewed records.
  - Add synthetic data for underrepresented groups (e.g., generate fake female applicant profiles).
  - Pre-process data to remove correlations with protected attributes.

##### ➤ Method 2: Modify the Model
Change how the AI learns:
- Instead of just maximizing accuracy, add a **fairness constraint** in the loss function.
- Penalize the model if it gives different true positive rates for different genders/races.
- Goal: Make correct predictions **equally likely for all groups**.

🎯 Example: Force the model to give same hiring chances to equally qualified men and women.

### 💡 Why Fairness Matters in Economics

Fair AI helps build a better economy:

| Area | Impact of Fair AI |
|------|-------------------|
| **Market Efficiency** | Ensures resources go to right people, not just privileged ones |
| **Recommender Systems** | Minority customers get relevant product suggestions (not just what majority buys) |
| **Social Policy Making** | Welfare funds reach those who *need* help most, not those who historically got it |
| **Competition** | Small businesses compete fairly against big firms using AI |

📌 Remember: **Fair ≠ Equal**  
→ Fair means giving more to those who **need more**, based on actual need, not past privilege.

---

## 🔹 3. **Interpretability (Explainable AI)**

### What is Interpretability?
> Can we understand **why** an AI made a certain decision?

Many powerful AI models (like deep neural networks) are **"black boxes"** — they give great results, but we don’t know *how* they reached them.

#### Example: ChatGPT
- Answers questions very well.
- But ask: *"Why did you say that?"* → Hard to explain!
- Because it has **billions of parameters** working together invisibly.

---

### ⚖️ Trade-off: Accuracy vs. Interpretability

| Model Type | Accuracy | Interpretability | Example |
|----------|---------|------------------|--------|
| **Simple Models** | Lower | High | Linear regression, decision trees |
| **Complex Models** | High | Low | Deep learning, random forests |

🟢 You can easily explain why a decision tree chose something.  
🔴 But complex models beat them in performance.

👉 Problem: In **safety-critical areas**, we need both **high accuracy AND explanation**.

---

### 📊 Example: Smart Grid Power Allocation
- An AI decides how much electricity each user gets.
- An auditor wants to check: Is this fair? Legal?
- But the model is a black box → impossible to verify.

Who’s responsible if there’s bias?
- Was it bad data?
- Or flawed model?

Without interpretability → **no accountability**.

---

### 🔍 Types of Interpretability Methods

#### ➤ A. **Local Explanations**
→ Explain **one single prediction**.

Example: Why was *this specific person* denied a loan?

Tools:
- **SHAP values (Shapley Additive Explanations)**: Shows how much each feature (income, age, credit score) contributed to the final decision.
  - Income lowered the chance? → Negative SHAP value.
  - Good credit history increased chance? → Positive SHAP value.

🧠 Like breaking down a grade: “You scored 70 because math (+30), science (-10), English (+50).”

#### ➤ B. **Global Explanations**
→ Explain the **entire model behavior**.

Example: What general rules does the AI follow?

Method:
- Build a **simple surrogate model** (like a decision tree) that mimics the complex model.
- Now you can look at the tree and say: “Ah, the AI mainly looks at income and employment status.”

📌 This is called **model distillation** or **post-hoc explanation**.

---

### 🔄 Two Approaches to Interpretability

| Approach | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Intrinsic (White Box)** | Use models that are naturally interpretable | Decision trees, linear models |
| **Post-Hoc (After the fact)** | Add explanations after a complex model makes a prediction | SHAP, LIME, surrogate models |

💡 Best practice: Use post-hoc tools with powerful models to get both **accuracy + understanding**.

---

## 🔹 4. **Environmental Impact of AI → Green AI**

### 🌍 Big Problem: AI Consumes Massive Energy

Modern AI (especially large language models like Transformers) requires:
- Thousands of GPUs
- Supercomputers
- Weeks of continuous training

All this computing uses **huge amounts of electricity** → leads to **high carbon emissions**.

---

### 📉 Shocking Fact:
> Training **one large AI model** (like a Transformer with 213 million parameters) emits **more CO₂ than an average human produces in an entire year!**

And that’s just for **training** — not even including deployment!

Compare:
| Source | Annual CO₂ Emission |
|-------|--------------------|
| Average human | ~5 tons |
| One AI model training | Up to **~300 tons** (some studies show even higher!) |

😱 That’s like driving a car for **600,000 km**!

---

### 🌱 What is Green AI?
> Building AI systems that are **environmentally friendly** — low energy, low carbon footprint.

### ✅ How to Achieve Green AI?

1. **Reuse Pre-Trained Models**
   - Don’t train a new model from scratch every time.
   - Use existing models (like BERT, GPT) and fine-tune them for your task.
   - Saves weeks of computation.

2. **Improve Hardware Efficiency**
   - Engineers should develop faster, energy-efficient chips (TPUs, etc.).

3. **Research in Domain Adaptation**
   - Learn how to adapt one pre-trained model to many different tasks.
   - Reduces need for retraining.

4. **Report Energy Usage**
   - Researchers should disclose how much energy their models consume.

📌 Just like food labels show calories, AI papers should show **carbon cost**.

## 🎯 Easy Memory Tricks (Mnemonics)

### For **Ethics**: Think **P.H.U.R.**
- **P**rivacy in data
- **H**uman in the loop
- **U**ncertainty reporting
- **R**egular testing & updates

### For **Bias Detection**: Ask:
- “Is the **error rate** the same across groups?”
- “Would changing the person’s gender/race change the outcome?”

### For **Fairness in Economics**:
> “Fair doesn’t mean equal. It means **giving according to need**, not wealth or history.”

### For **Interpretability**:
> “If you can’t explain it, you can’t trust it.”  
Use **SHAP** for local, **surrogate models** for global.

### For **Green AI**:
> “Don’t bake a new cake every time — **use leftovers wisely!**”  
→ Reuse pre-trained models instead of training new ones.
