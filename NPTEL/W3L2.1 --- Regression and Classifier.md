Certainly! Below is a **complete and simplified explanation** of the topics discussed in the transcript, including all key concepts, examples, and mathematical expressions—explained in plain language without omitting any information.

### 🌞 Welcome & Introduction

Hello! The speaker, **Adyay Mitra**, an Assistant Professor at **IIT Kharagpur**, welcomes everyone to a course on **Artificial Intelligence for Economics**. This is **Lecture 12**, focusing on two important machine learning techniques:  
- **Linear Regression**  
- **Classifiers (especially Linear Classifiers)**

These tools help us **learn from past data** and **make predictions about future data**.

So far in the course:
- We’ve studied **unsupervised learning**, like **k-means clustering** and **agglomerative clustering**.
- In the last lecture, we learned about **Decision Trees**, which are a type of classifier.

Now, we move to **supervised learning**, where both input data and correct answers (called "labels") are known during training.

---

### 🔍 What is Supervised Learning?

In supervised learning:
- You have a dataset with **observations (examples)**.
- Each observation has:
  - A **feature vector**: $x_i$ — this contains measurable attributes or inputs (like age, income, product features).
  - A **label (output)**: $y_i$ — this is what you want to predict (like “cat” or “dog”, or a numerical rating).

For example:
- If predicting whether an animal is a cat or dog → label is categorical ("classification").
- If predicting house prices → label is continuous ("regression").

We have $n$ such observations:  
$(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$

Each $x_i$ can be a **d-dimensional vector** (i.e., it has $d$ features):  
$x_i = [x_{i1}, x_{i2}, ..., x_{id}]$

All feature vectors live in a space called the **feature space**.  
All labels live in the **label space**.

🎯 **Goal of Supervised Learning**:  
Given a new feature vector $x$, predict its label $y$.  
To do this, we need to find a function $f$ such that:

$$
y = f(x)
$$

This function maps from the **feature space** to the **label space**.

---

### 🧠 Types of Functions: Explicit vs Algorithmic

The function $f$ can be:
1. **Explicit mathematical formula** – e.g., a polynomial like $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$
2. **An algorithm** – e.g., a decision tree that uses rules to make decisions based on features

Both types work as long as they map inputs to outputs correctly.

---

### 📊 Two Main Problems in Supervised Learning

Depending on the **type of label space**, supervised learning splits into two categories:

| Type | Label Space | Example |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Classification** | Discrete values (e.g., cat/dog, yes/no) | Predicting if a customer will buy a product |
| **Regression** | Continuous real numbers (e.g., price, temperature) | Predicting GDP growth rate |

---

### 🛠️ General Approach to Supervised Learning

Here’s how we build a model:

#### Step 1: Make a Hypothesis About $ f $

We assume a form for the function $f$. For example:
- Maybe $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ → quadratic hypothesis
- Or maybe $f(x) = w^T x + w_0$ → linear hypothesis

We don’t yet know the exact values of parameters like $a, b, w, w_0$ — those we’ll learn from data.

#### Step 2: Use Training Data to Calibrate (Train) the Model

We use known data: $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$  
This is called **training data**.

Our goal: Find parameter values so that:
$$
f(x_1) \approx y_1,\quad f(x_2) \approx y_2,\quad ..., \quad f(x_n) \approx y_n
$$

This process of estimating parameters is called **calibration** or **training**.

#### Step 3: Define a Loss Function

A **loss function** measures how bad our prediction is compared to the true value.

Let:
- True label: $y$
- Predicted label: $\hat{y} = f(x)$

Then loss is written as:
$$
L(y, \hat{y}) = L(y, f(x))
$$

It should be low when prediction is good, high when wrong.

For multiple examples ($ n $), total loss is:
$$
\text{Total Loss} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} L(y_i, f(x_i))
$$

🎯 **Training Objective**: Choose parameters of $ f $ to **minimize this total loss**.

Ideally, $f(x_i) = y_i$ for all $i$ → loss = 0  
But in practice, we just try to make loss as small as possible.

#### Step 4: Validation (Testing)

After training, test the model on **new data not used in training**.

If predictions are accurate here too, the model generalizes well.

If not, go back and improve the model (e.g., change parameters, adjust hypothesis).

### 🐱🐶 Example: Cat vs Dog Image Classification

Imagine you want to classify images as either **cat** or **dog**.

Each image is represented by a set of **features** (e.g., ear shape, fur color, eye size). These form a feature vector $x$.

Labels: $y = \text{"cat"}$ or $y = \text{"dog"}$

You train your model using labeled images.

During testing:
- Input: New image → extract features → feed into trained model
- Output: Prediction (say, “dog”)
- Reality: It's actually a cat → **misclassification**

Loss detected → alert raised → update model parameters → retrain

Eventually, after tuning, prediction matches reality (“cat”) → success!

This loop of train → test → fix errors → retrain is central to supervised learning.

---

### 📈 Linear Regression: Simplest Form of Regression

Now let’s focus on **regression**, especially **linear regression**, the simplest kind.

#### Assumption: $ f $ is Linear

We assume:
$$
f(x) = w^T x + w_0
$$

Where:
- $x$: feature vector (e.g., product quality, delivery speed)
- $w$: weight vector (how important each feature is)
- $w_0$: bias term (baseline prediction when all features are zero)

Note: We can absorb $w_0 $ into $ w $ by adding a constant 1 to $ x $, so we often write simply:
$$
f(x) = w^T x
$$

🎯 Goal: Estimate the best $ w $ using training data.

---

### 💡 Real-World Application: Product Rating Prediction

Suppose users rate products based on various features (price, quality, design, etc.).

We want to **predict overall user rating** based on these features.

Assume:
- Overall rating $ y_i $ is a **weighted sum** of individual feature scores.
- Different users may value features differently.

So initially, we might think:
$$
y_i = \sum_{j=1}^{n} w_{ij} x_j
$$
Where:
- $w_{ij}$: importance (weight) user $ i $ gives to feature $ j $
- $x_j$: value/score of feature $ j $

But wait — this creates **too many parameters**! With $ m $ users and $ n $ features, we have $ m \times n $ weights → hard to estimate.

So we simplify.

---

### 🔁 Simplified Model: Same Weights Across Users

Instead of different weights per user, assume **all users share the same weights**.

That is:
$$
w_{ij} \rightarrow w_j
$$
Only depends on feature $ j $, not user $ i $

Then predicted rating for item $ i $ becomes:
$$
h_i = w^T x_i
$$
(Note: Here $ i $ now refers to the product/item, not the user.)

True rating is $ y_i $

We compare them using **squared error loss**:
$$
L = (y_i - w^T x_i)^2
$$

Why square? Because:
- Errors can be positive or negative
- Without squaring, +5 and -5 would cancel out → total loss = 0 even though big mistakes were made
- Squaring ensures all losses are positive → errors add up properly

Total loss over all $ m $ items:
$$
\text{Total Loss} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} (y_i - w^T x_i)^2
$$

(There was a typo in the original transcript — missing summation over $ j $, corrected here.)

---

### 🔍 Finding Best Weights $ w $

We need to choose $ w $ to minimize total loss.

Mathematically:
$$
\min_w \sum_{i=1}^{m} (y_i - w^T x_i)^2
$$

This is a classic optimization problem.

Let’s organize data:
- Let $ X $ be an $ m \times n $ matrix: each row is one $ x_i $ (so $ m $ rows, $ n $ columns/features)
- Let $ y $ be an $ m \times 1 $ column vector: true ratings $ [y_1, y_2, ..., y_m]^T $

Then the optimal weight vector $ w $ is given by:
$$
w = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y
$$

✅ This formula comes from calculus — take derivative of loss w.r.t. $ w $, set to zero, solve.

Result: An $ n \times 1 $ vector $ w $, giving the **importance (weight)** of each feature.

Now you can predict rating for any new product: $ \hat{y} = w^T x $

---

### ⚙️ Feature Selection & Sparsity

But here’s a problem: In real life, people don’t care about *all* features.

Example: When rating a phone, some only care about battery; others care about camera.

So ideally, only relevant features should have non-zero weights. Others should be zero.

That is, we want **sparse** $ w $: most entries are zero.

How to achieve this?

Use **Regularization**!

Add a penalty term to the loss function to encourage sparsity.

New objective:
$$
\text{Minimize: } \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^{m} (y_i - w^T x_i)^2}_{\text{Prediction Error}} + \lambda \cdot \underbrace{f(w)}_{\text{Regularizer}}
$$

Here, $\lambda$ controls trade-off:
- High $\lambda$: more emphasis on simplicity/sparsity
- Low $\lambda$: more focus on fitting data perfectly

What should $f(w)$ be?

#### Option 1: $ L_0 $ Norm → Count non-zero elements
$$
f(w) = \|w\|_0 = \text{number of non-zero components in } w
$$
Perfect for sparsity, but **mathematically hard to optimize** (not continuous).

#### Option 2: $ L_1 $ Norm → Sum of absolute values
$$
f(w) = \|w\|_1 = |w_1| + |w_2| + ... + |w_n|
$$
Easier to optimize and promotes sparsity.

👉 This method is called **Lasso Regression**  
(LASSO = **Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator**)

As $\lambda$ increases:
- Sparsity increases (more zeros in $ w $)
- Prediction accuracy decreases slightly

Trade-off between **accuracy** and **simplicity/interpretability**

💡 Why useful in economics?
- Helps identify which variables truly affect outcomes (e.g., inflation, GDP)
- Removes irrelevant predictors → better models + deeper insights

### ✂️ From Regression to Classification: Binary Case

Can we use similar ideas for **classification**?

Yes! Let’s consider **binary classification**: two classes.

Assign labels:
- Class 1: $ y = +1 $ (e.g., “dog”)
- Class 2: $ y = -1 $ (e.g., “cat”)

We still use a linear function:
$$
\text{Score} = w^T x
$$

But instead of outputting the score directly, apply the **sign function**:
$$
\hat{y} = \text{sign}(w^T x) = 
\begin{cases}
+1 & \text{if } w^T x > 0 \\
-1 & \text{if } w^T x < 0
\end{cases}
$$

Geometrically:
- All points where $w^T x = 0$ lie on a **line (in 2D)** or **hyperplane (in higher dimensions)**
- Points on one side → class +1
- Points on other side → class -1

🎯 So classification becomes: **find a line/hyperplane that separates the two classes**

If such a line exists → data is **linearly separable**

Not all datasets are linearly separable — many are mixed together.

But **if** it is separable, then perfect classification is possible.

---

### 🤖 Perceptron Algorithm: Simple Classifier

One simple way to find $ w $ is the **Perceptron Algorithm**:

1. Start with random $ w $
2. Go through each training example:
   - Compute prediction: $\hat{y}_i = \text{sign}(w^T x_i)$
   - Compare with true label $ y_i $
   - If wrong → update $ w $:
     $$
     w := w + \eta \cdot y_i \cdot x_i
     $$
     (where $ \eta $ is a small step size)

Repeat until no errors.

✅ If data is **linearly separable**, perceptron will eventually converge to a solution.

But: There might be **many possible lines** that separate the data.

Which one is best?

---

### 🛡️ Max-Margin Classifier: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Consider two solutions:

- **Solution 1**: Line very close to some points → unstable. Small noise could flip prediction.
- **Solution 2**: Line far from both classes → safer, more robust.

We prefer the one with **maximum margin** — distance between the line and nearest points of each class.

👉 This is called the **Max-Margin Linear Classifier**

Estimated using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

SVM finds $ w $ that maximizes the margin while correctly classifying all points (if separable).

Requires advanced math: **quadratic programming**, **optimization techniques** (like interior point methods)

We won’t dive deep, but know:
- SVM gives **stable, robust classifiers**
- Works well when data is linearly separable

---

### 🔁 Multi-Class Classification

Even if there are more than 2 classes (e.g., cat, dog, bird), we can break it down into multiple binary problems:
- Cat vs Not-Cat
- Dog vs Not-Dog
- Bird vs Not-Bird

So solving binary classification helps solve **any classification task**

---

### 💼 Applications in Economics

Both regression and classification are widely used:

#### 1. **Financial Risk Assessment**
- Predict stock market trends
- Forecast GDP growth
- Estimate credit risk

Use economic indicators (unemployment, interest rates, trade balance) as features.

Formulate as linear model → use linear regression/classification.

#### 2. **Variable Selection**
- Often, we don’t know which factors matter.
- Throw in many variables → use **Lasso Regression**
- Automatically sets unimportant ones to zero
- Reveals key drivers → improves forecasting + provides insight

Example: Which policies most impact poverty reduction?
