### 🎓 Welcome to the Lecture: Artificial Intelligence for Economics

This lecture introduces a powerful technique used in data analysis called **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**. PCA helps simplify large datasets by reducing the number of variables — this is known as **dimensionality reduction**. When we have too many features or columns in our data (like income, age, education, spending habits, etc.), PCA helps us shrink them into fewer, more meaningful ones.

But before diving into PCA, we need to learn some **mathematical tools** that are essential for understanding how PCA works. These include:

1. Random vectors  
2. Vector differentiation  
3. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors  
4. Lagrange optimization  

Let’s go through each one step by step.

---

### 1️⃣ Random Vectors (Vectors of Random Variables)

We start with something familiar: a **random variable**, like someone’s height or income. A random variable has:
- A **probability distribution** (how likely different values are)
- An **expected value (mean)** – average value
- A **variance** – how spread out the values are

Now imagine not just one random variable, but a list of them:  
For example: [Height, Weight, Age] → this is a **random vector**.

So if `x` is a vector like this:
```
x = [x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ]
```
Then:
- The **expectation (mean)** of this vector is also a vector:
  ```
  E[x] = [E[x₁], E[x₂], ..., E[xₙ]] = [μ₁, μ₂, ..., μₙ]
  ```
  This gives the average of each variable.

- The **variance** of a random vector is not a single number — it’s a **matrix** called the **covariance matrix**, denoted by Σ (sigma).

To compute it:
- Take each observation minus its mean: `(x - μ)`
- Multiply it by its transpose: `(x - μ)(x - μ)ᵀ`
- Then take the **expectation** of that matrix.

Result? A square matrix (n×n) where:
- The **diagonal elements** (top-left to bottom-right) are the **variances** of each individual variable.
  - Example: Σ₁₁ = Variance of x₁
- The **off-diagonal elements** (not on the diagonal) are the **covariances** between two variables.
  - Example: Σ₁₂ = Covariance between x₁ and x₂ → tells you how much they change together

👉 So, the **covariance matrix** captures both how each variable varies on its own and how pairs of variables move together.

This is crucial because PCA uses this matrix to find patterns in data.

### 2️⃣ Vector Differentiation (How to Differentiate Functions with Vectors)

In calculus, we know how to take derivatives of functions. But when dealing with multiple variables (like in machine learning), we work with **functions of vectors**.

Suppose you have a function `f(x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ)` — a multivariable function.

The derivative of this function with respect to the entire vector `x = [x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ]` is called the **gradient**, written as ∇f or ∂f/∂x.

It’s a **vector** made up of all the partial derivatives:
```
Gradient = [∂f/∂x₁, ∂f/∂x₂, ..., ∂f/∂xₙ]
```

Two special cases were shown:

#### 🔹 Case 1: Function is `aᵀx` (dot product of constant vector `a` and variable vector `x`)
Example:
- `a = [a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ]`
- `x = [x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ]`
- Then `aᵀx = a₁x₁ + a₂x₂ + ... + aₙxₙ`

When you differentiate this with respect to `x`, you get:
> **Answer: `a`**

So,
```
∂(aᵀx)/∂x = a
```

This means the rate of change of the dot product with respect to `x` is just the vector `a`.

#### 🔹 Case 2: Function is `xᵀAx` (quadratic form), where `A` is a symmetric matrix
Here:
- `x` is a vector
- `A` is an n×n symmetric matrix (meaning Aᵢⱼ = Aⱼᵢ)

Then `xᵀAx` results in a **scalar** (a single number). For example, in 2D:
```
x = [x₁, x₂], A = [[A₁₁, A₁₂],[A₁₂, A₂₂]]
→ xᵀAx = A₁₁x₁² + A₂₂x₂² + 2A₁₂x₁x₂
```

Now, take the derivative of this with respect to `x`. After working through an example, we find:
> **Answer: `2Ax`**

So,
```
∂(xᵀAx)/∂x = 2Ax   (when A is symmetric)
```

These two rules are very important in PCA and will be used later.

---

### 3️⃣ Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Imagine multiplying a vector by a matrix. Usually, this changes both the **direction** and **length** of the vector.

But some special vectors don’t change direction — only their length changes. These are called **eigenvectors**.

#### What is an eigenvector?

If you multiply a matrix `A` by a vector `x`, and the result is just a scaled version of `x` (same direction, maybe longer or shorter), then:
```
A x = λ x
```
- `x` is the **eigenvector**
- `λ` (lambda) is the **eigenvalue** — tells you how much the vector stretches or shrinks

💡 Think of it like this: eigenvectors are the "special directions" along which the matrix acts like a simple stretch/shrink.

#### How do we find eigenvalues and eigenvectors?

Given a matrix `A`, solve:
```
A x = λ x
→ A x - λ x = 0
→ (A - λI) x = 0
```
Where `I` is the identity matrix (1s on diagonal, 0s elsewhere).

For non-zero solutions (`x ≠ 0`), the determinant must be zero:
```
det(A - λI) = 0
```

Solving this equation gives the **eigenvalues** (λ). Once you have λ, plug back in to find corresponding **eigenvectors**.

##### Example:
Matrix:
```
A = [[1, 2],
     [5, 4]]
```

Compute:
```
det([[1−λ, 2],
     [5, 4−λ]]) = 0
→ (1−λ)(4−λ) − (2)(5) = 0
→ λ² − 5λ − 6 = 0
→ Solutions: λ = 6 and λ = −1
```

So, eigenvalues are **6** and **−1**.

Now find eigenvectors:

- For λ = 6:
  Solve `(A - 6I)x = 0`
  Result: x₂ = (5/2)x₁ → eigenvector is any multiple of `[1, 5/2]`

- For λ = −1:
  Similarly, solve → get another set of vectors

Note: Any scalar multiple of an eigenvector is also an eigenvector.

Why does this matter?
- In PCA, eigenvectors of the covariance matrix tell us the **main directions** (patterns) in the data.
- Eigenvalues tell us how strong those patterns are.

---

### 4️⃣ Lagrange Optimization (Optimizing Under Constraints)

Sometimes you want to **maximize or minimize a function**, but there’s a **constraint**.

Example: Among all rectangles with perimeter 20, which has the largest area?

Let:
- Length = b
- Width = a
- Perimeter constraint: 2(a + b) = 20 → a + b = 10
- Area to maximize: f(a,b) = a × b

We can’t just maximize freely — we must obey the constraint.

#### Enter: **Lagrange Multipliers**

We create a new function called the **Lagrangian**:
```
L(a, b, λ) = Objective + λ × (Constraint)
```
Actually, it’s:
```
L = ab + λ(20 - 2a - 2b)
```
Or simpler: use `g(a,b) = 2a + 2b - 20 = 0`

Then define:
```
L = ab + λ(20 - 2a - 2b)
```

Now take partial derivatives and set them to zero:
1. ∂L/∂a = b - 2λ = 0 → b = 2λ
2. ∂L/∂b = a - 2λ = 0 → a = 2λ
3. ∂L/∂λ = 20 - 2a - 2b = 0 → original constraint

From (1) and (2): a = b  
Plug into constraint: 2a + 2a = 20 → 4a = 20 → a = 5, b = 5

✅ So the rectangle with maximum area under fixed perimeter is a **square**!

That’s **Lagrange optimization**: a method to solve constrained optimization problems using gradients and multipliers.

This technique will be used in PCA to find directions that **maximize variance** under certain constraints.

Sure! Here's a **complete, clear, and simplified explanation** of everything discussed in the transcript — no information omitted, just explained in simple terms:

### 🌟 Introduction: Why We Need PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

The lecture begins with a real-world story about a **small financial institution** that gives out loans in rural areas. Their main worry is **loan defaulters** — people who borrow money but don’t pay it back.

To predict who might default, they collect data on each customer using several features like:
- How much they spend
- Whether they make advance payments
- Delay in payments
- Current account balance
- Credit limit
...and so on.

This results in **7 different features (or variables)** for every customer. But here’s the problem: they only have data from **210 customers** — not many compared to the number of features.

So, we have:
- **Too many features** (7)
- **Too few customers/data points** (210)

This imbalance causes a big issue called **overfitting**, where a machine learning model learns patterns from noise or random quirks in the training data instead of general trends. As a result, when tested on new data, the model performs poorly.

They tried using **logistic regression** (a common prediction method) and got only **68% accuracy**, which isn't great.

This leads us to a core idea:  
👉 **We need to reduce the number of features without losing too much useful information.**

---

### 🔍 Two Ways to Reduce Features

There are two main ways to simplify data with many features:

#### 1. **Feature Selection**
You simply **pick a few important features** from the original ones and ignore the rest.

Example: Out of 7 customer features, you choose only 4 — say, spending, delay, balance, and credit limit — and drop the others.

It’s like selecting some ingredients from a recipe rather than creating something new.

#### 2. **Feature Extraction**
Instead of picking existing features, you **create brand-new features** by combining the old ones in smart ways.

These new features should capture most of the important information from the original data, but there will be **fewer of them**.

👉 This lecture focuses on one powerful feature extraction technique: **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**.

---

### 🧩 What Is PCA?

PCA creates **new features** (called **principal components**) by taking **weighted combinations** of all the original features.

For example:
- Original features: Spending, Advance Payment, Delay, Balance, etc.
- New feature (PC1): `0.5×Spending + 0.3×Delay − 0.2×Balance + ...`

Each principal component is such a combination.

And importantly:
- There are **fewer principal components** than original features.
- Each one tries to capture as much **variability (information)** in the data as possible.
- The goal is to **minimize information loss** while reducing complexity.

Think of it like summarizing a long book into bullet points — you keep the key ideas, but in fewer words.

---

### 📐 Visualizing PCA: Rotating Axes

Imagine plotting your data on a graph with two axes: X1 and X2. Now imagine rotating those axes to get new directions (let’s call them PC1 and PC2).

The first new axis (**PC1**) is chosen along the direction where the data varies the most — meaning the spread of points is widest along this line.

The second new axis (**PC2**) is perpendicular (orthogonal) to the first and captures the next highest variation.

> ✅ Key idea: Principal components are **new axes** that show the directions of maximum variability in the data.

#### Example:
Suppose all your data points lie close to a diagonal line like from (1,1) to (10,10). Instead of needing both X1 and X2 to describe them, you could just use one value: **X2 – X1** (which stays constant). That single number can represent the trend!

Even though "X2 – X1" looks like subtraction, mathematically it’s still a **linear combination**:  
`(-1)×X1 + (+1)×X2`

So PCA finds such smart combinations automatically.

---

### 🔁 Math Behind Rotation = Linear Combinations

When we rotate coordinate axes by an angle θ, the new coordinates (Z1, Z2) relate to the old ones (X1, X2) through trigonometry formulas involving sine and cosine.

But these formulas turn out to be **linear combinations** of the original variables.

Also, the weights used in these combinations form vectors of length 1 (unit vectors), ensuring stability.

Thus:
> 🔁 Rotating axes ↔ Creating new features via linear combinations with unit-length weight vectors.

Now the question becomes: **Which rotation (i.e., which combination) is best?**

---

### 🎯 How PCA Chooses the Best Components

Here’s how PCA decides which new features (components) to create:

1. **First Principal Component (PC1)**:
   - It is the **linear combination** of original features that shows the **maximum variance** (spread).
   - More variance = more information captured.

2. **Second Principal Component (PC2)**:
   - Also has high variance, but must be **perpendicular (orthogonal)** to PC1.
   - Captures the next most variation that PC1 didn’t catch.

3. **Third Principal Component (PC3)**:
   - Must be orthogonal to both PC1 and PC2.
   - Again, maximizes remaining variance.

And so on...

✅ So each new component:
- Captures as much leftover variation as possible,
- While being independent (uncorrelated) with previous components.

This ensures no redundancy — each component adds unique insight.

---

### 📘 Mathematical Setup of PCA

Let’s go deeper into the math step-by-step.

Say you have:
- A vector **X** = [X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ] representing n original features for a person (e.g., 7 features per customer).
- You want to create a new feature:  
  **Z = a₁X₁ + a₂X₂ + ... + aₙXₙ = AᵀX**  
  Where A is a vector of weights (like [a₁, a₂,...]).

Your goal: Choose weights A so that the **variance of Z is maximized**, because higher variance means more information.

But you can’t let the weights grow infinitely large — that would artificially inflate variance.

So you add a constraint:  
👉 **A must be a unit vector**: AᵀA = 1 (sum of squares of weights = 1)

This turns PCA into a **constrained optimization problem**:
> Maximize Variance(Z) = AᵀΣA  
> Subject to AᵀA = 1

Where:
- Σ (sigma) is the **covariance matrix** of the original features.
- It tells how each pair of features varies together.
- Since we don’t know the true Σ, we estimate it from data → **Sample covariance matrix (Σ̂)**

---

### 🛠 Solving the Optimization Problem Using Lagrange Multipliers

To solve:
> Maximize AᵀΣ̂A  
> With constraint AᵀA = 1

We use **Lagrange multipliers** — a method from calculus.

Define the **Lagrangian**:
> L = AᵀΣ̂A – β(AᵀA – 1)

Then take derivative w.r.t. A and set to zero:
> dL/dA = 2Σ̂A – 2βA = 0  
> ⇒ Σ̂A = βA

This equation should look familiar!

👉 This is the **Eigenvalue Equation**!

So:
- The optimal weight vector **A** is an **eigenvector** of the covariance matrix Σ̂
- The multiplier **β** is the corresponding **eigenvalue**

And remember our constraint: A must be a **unit vector**, so we pick the **unit eigenvector**.

---

### 💡 Key Insight: Eigenvalues = Variances of PCs

From above:
- The **j-th principal component** is given by: **Zⱼ = AⱼᵀX**
- Its **variance** is: **AⱼᵀΣ̂Aⱼ**
- But since Σ̂Aⱼ = βⱼAⱼ, this simplifies to:  
  Variance(Zⱼ) = βⱼ (because AⱼᵀAⱼ = 1)

✅ So:
> The **eigenvalues (βⱼ)** of the covariance matrix = **Variances of the principal components**

Hence:
- Larger eigenvalue → more variance explained → more important the component

---

### ❓ But Wait — Did We Forget Orthogonality?

Earlier, we said each PC must be **orthogonal** to the others.

But in our optimization, we only maximized variance under the unit vector constraint. We didn’t explicitly enforce orthogonality between components.

So is our solution wrong?

➡️ **No! Because of a beautiful property of symmetric matrices.**

The sample covariance matrix **Σ̂ is symmetric** (since Cov(X,Y) = Cov(Y,X)).

And here’s a theorem:
> For a symmetric matrix, **eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues are always orthogonal**.

Since PCA picks eigenvectors one by one (starting from largest eigenvalue), and they naturally come out orthogonal, the **orthogonality condition is automatically satisfied**!

✅ So even though we ignored it during optimization, it works out perfectly thanks to linear algebra.

---

### 🧮 Step-by-Step PCA Procedure

So now we know exactly what to do:

1. **Start with data**: n observations, p features each.
2. **Compute the sample covariance matrix Σ̂**
   - Calculate variances and covariances between all pairs of features
3. **Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Σ̂**
   - Sort them in descending order of eigenvalues
4. **Pick top k eigenvectors** (unit length) → These give the principal components
5. **New features** = Projections: PC₁ = A₁ᵀX, PC₂ = A₂ᵀX, etc.
6. **Variance explained by each PC** = Its eigenvalue

---

### 📊 Example: Two Variables (X and Y)

Let’s test PCA on a tiny dataset:
- X values: [1, 3, 3, 5, 5]
- Y values: [2, 3, 5, 4, 6]

Steps:
1. Compute variances and covariance
2. Build covariance matrix Σ̂
3. Find eigenvalues: β₁ ≈ 9.34, β₂ ≈ 0.41
4. Total variance = 9.34 + 0.41 = 9.75
5. % variance explained:
   - PC1: 9.34 / 9.75 ≈ **96%**
   - PC2: 0.41 / 9.75 ≈ **4%**

🎉 So just **one principal component (PC1)** captures nearly all the information!

That means instead of using both X and Y, we can safely replace them with **just PC1** and lose very little detail.

This reduces dimensionality from 2D → 1D.

---

### 🏁 Back to the Loan Default Dataset

Now apply PCA to the original loan data:
- 7 original features per customer
- Only 210 customers → Risk of overfitting

Using Python's `sklearn.decomposition.PCA`, the instructor computes:

| Principal Component | % Variance Explained |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| PC1                 | 78%                    |
| PC2                 | 12%                    |
| PC3                 | 6%                     |
| Total (first 3)     | ~96%                   |

So:
> Just **3 principal components** explain **over 96% of the total variation** in the data!

Therefore:
- Replace the 7 original features with **only 3 new ones**: PC1, PC2, PC3
- Keep the target variable unchanged: **Defaulter (Yes/No)**

Now retrain the logistic regression model on this reduced dataset.

Result?
➡️ Accuracy improves from **68% → 83%**

Why better?
- Fewer features → less noise
- Less overfitting
- Model generalizes better to unseen data

---
