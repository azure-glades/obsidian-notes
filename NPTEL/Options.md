### **Long vs. Short Positions in Options**

In options trading, "long" and "short" simply refer to whether you're buying or selling a contract. It's the core concept that determines your rights, obligations, and risk/reward profile.

***

### **Long Options (Buying)**

A long option position means you **bought** an options contract. This gives you a **right**, but not an obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset. The maximum loss for a long position is the premium you paid for the option.

* **Long Call:** You buy a call option, betting the underlying asset's price will **increase**. You have the right to **buy** the asset at the strike price. Your potential profit is theoretically unlimited, and your risk is limited to the premium you paid.
* **Long Put:** You buy a put option, betting the underlying asset's price will **decrease**. You have the right to **sell** the asset at the strike price. Your potential profit is substantial (as the stock can only go to zero), and your risk is limited to the premium you paid.

### **Short Options (Selling)**

A short option position means you **sold** or "wrote" an options contract. This gives you an **obligation** to either buy or sell the underlying asset if the buyer of the option chooses to exercise it. The maximum profit for a short position is the premium you received from the sale.

* **Short Call:** You sell a call option, betting the underlying asset's price will **not increase significantly** or will decrease. You have the obligation to **sell** the asset at the strike price if the buyer exercises their option. Your potential profit is limited to the premium received, but your potential loss is theoretically unlimited. This is a very high-risk strategy, especially if you don't own the underlying stock (a "naked" short call).
* **Short Put:** You sell a put option, betting the underlying asset's price will **not decrease significantly** or will increase. You have the obligation to **buy** the asset at the strike price if the buyer exercises their option. Your potential profit is limited to the premium received, while your potential loss can be substantial if the stock price plummets.
