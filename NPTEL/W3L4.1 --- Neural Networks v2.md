### 🌟 Welcome & Introduction

Hello everyone! This is **Lecture 14** of a course on **Artificial Intelligence for Economics**, taught by **Adway Mitra**, an Assistant Professor at IIT Kharagpur.

Today’s topic is: **Neural Networks**.

Before this lecture, we’ve already learned how computers (or AI) can **learn from data** — that is, use past observations to understand patterns and predict future outcomes.

We started with:
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Like grouping similar things together (called *clustering*).
- Then moved to **Supervised Learning**: Where we have labeled data (like knowing which items belong to which category), and we teach the machine to classify new items correctly.

In supervised learning, we studied:
- **Decision Trees**: A flowchart-like way to make decisions.
- **Linear Classifiers**: A method where we try to draw a straight line (or plane) to separate different groups in the data.

But there was a big limitation: **linear classifiers only work well when the data can be separated by a straight line** — what we call "linearly separable" data.

That’s not always true in real life. So today, we move beyond straight lines and learn about something much more powerful: **Neural Networks**.

### 🔍 What Is a Linear Classifier? (Quick Recap)

Let’s first remember how a **linear classifier** works.

Imagine you’re trying to decide whether someone will buy a product or not, based on features like their age, income, job type, etc.

Each person is represented as a **feature vector** `x` (a list of numbers). The model tries to predict a label: `+1` (yes, they’ll buy) or `-1` (no, they won’t).

The formula used is:

> **y = sign(w · x)**

Where:
- `x` = input features (e.g., age, income)
- `w` = weights (numbers the model learns — one for each feature)
- `w · x` = dot product (multiply each feature with its weight and add them up)
- `sign()` = returns +1 if the sum is positive, -1 if negative

This creates a **decision boundary** — a line (in 2D), a plane (in 3D), or a hyperplane (in higher dimensions) — that separates the two classes.

👉 But again, this only works if such a straight-line separation exists.

### 🧩 Representing a Linear Classifier as a Graph

Now, here comes the fun part!

We can **draw** this linear classifier as a kind of network:
- Each input feature (`x₁`, `x₂`, ..., `x₄`) becomes a **node** (circle) on the left — these are called **input nodes**.
- There’s one final **output node** on the right — this gives us the prediction (+1 or -1).
- Every input node connects to the output node via **edges** (lines), and each edge has a **weight** (`w₁`, `w₂`, etc.).
- We also add a special **bias node** (value = 1) connected to the output with weight `w₀`. This helps shift the decision line around.

At the output node:
1. Multiply each input by its corresponding weight.
2. Add all those products together (this is the weighted sum).
3. Apply the `sign()` function to get the final output.

✅ So, this little graph is just another way to represent the same math we did earlier.

And guess what? **This simple structure is actually the basic building block of a neural network!**

### 🔄 From Linear to More Complex Classifiers

But what if our data **can’t** be split by a single straight line?

#### Example 1: Multilinear Classifier (Using Multiple Lines)

Suppose red dots (class +1) are on both ends of a graph, and blue dots (-1) are in the middle.

No single straight line can separate red from blue.

BUT — what if we use **two lines**?
- Line C₁ separates left reds from blues.
- Line C₂ separates right reds from blues.

Then we say:
> If **C₁ says +1 OR C₂ says +1**, then overall result is **+1**.

So now we need **two steps**:
1. Compute predictions from **both** C₁ and C₂.
2. Combine them using **logical OR**.

To do this, we need **intermediate calculations** — not directly from inputs to output, but through **middle steps**.

In our graph:
- We now have **two hidden nodes** (one for C₁, one for C₂).
- These connect to the final output node.
- The final output combines the results using logic (OR).

These intermediate nodes are called **hidden nodes**, and the layer they form is called a **hidden layer**.

🧠 This expanded version is still a neural network — but now it can handle more complex patterns than just straight lines.

---

#### Example 2: Non-linear Data – Circular Pattern

Now imagine data shaped like **concentric circles**:
- Green dots inside a circle.
- Red dots outside.

There’s **no straight line** that can separate them.

But a **circle** could!

We can define a rule like:
> If `(x - x₀)² + (y - y₀)² < r²` → point is inside → class = -1  
> Else → outside → class = +1

This is a **non-linear** (quadratic) function because it involves squares.

Our old linear classifier can't do this.

So how can a neural network help?

By introducing **non-linear activation functions**!

Instead of just doing `sign(weighted sum)`, we apply a **more flexible function `f`** that can capture curves and bends.

So instead of:
> Output = sign(w·x)

We do:
> Output = f(w·x)

Where `f` is some **non-linear function** (we'll explain which ones later).

This allows the network to model **curved decision boundaries**, like circles.

### 🧠 Biological Inspiration: Neurons in the Brain

Why call it a “neural” network?

Because it’s inspired by real **biological neurons** in our brains!

A biological neuron:
- Receives signals through **dendrites** (inputs),
- Processes them,
- Sends output through **axon terminals** (output).

Similarly:
- Input nodes = dendrites
- Hidden/output nodes = processing units
- Edges with weights = strength of connections

Just like brain cells work together in layers, artificial neural networks process information in stages.

---

### 🏗️ General Structure of a Neural Network

Here’s how a full neural network looks:

1. **Input Layer**: One node per feature (like age, income, etc.)
2. **Hidden Layers**: One or more layers between input and output.
   - Each layer has several **nodes** (also called neurons or units).
   - Nodes in one layer connect to all nodes in the next (usually).
   - Each connection has a **weight**.
3. **Output Layer**: Gives the final answer (prediction).

Information flows **from left to right** — input → hidden layers → output.

This flow is called **feedforward propagation**.

#### Step-by-step Computation

At each node in a hidden layer:
1. Take all incoming values.
2. Multiply each by its edge weight.
3. Add them up (plus a **bias** term).
4. Apply a **non-linear activation function** (like `f`, `g`, etc.).

Repeat this for every layer until you reach the output.

Mathematically:
- First hidden layer: `h₁ = f₁(W₁·x + b₁)`
- Second: `h₂ = f₂(W₂·h₁ + b₂)`
- ...
- Final output: `y = g(V·hₗ + c)`

Where:
- `W₁, W₂,...` = weight matrices
- `b₁, b₂,...` = bias terms
- `f₁, f₂,..., g` = activation functions
- `l` = number of hidden layers

💡 The deeper the network (more hidden layers), the more complex the patterns it can learn.

Modern neural networks often have **hundreds of layers** and **millions of parameters**!

---

### ⚙️ Components You Need to Design

When building a neural network, you must decide:

1. **How many hidden layers?** (Value of `L`)
2. **How many nodes in each layer?** (Sizes `d₁`, `d₂`, ..., `d_L`)
3. **What activation functions to use?** (Choices for `f₁`, `f₂`, ..., `g`)

⚠️ There’s **no golden rule** for choosing these. It depends on the problem and requires experimentation.

These choices are made by the **machine learning engineer**.

However, the actual **numerical values of the weights (W₁, W₂, ...)** are **not chosen manually** — they are **learned from data**.

---

### 📉 Training the Network: Minimizing Loss

Like other models, neural networks learn by minimizing a **loss function**.

The loss measures:
> How far is the network’s prediction `f(x)` from the true label `y`?

For example:
- In classification: Use cross-entropy loss.
- In regression: Use squared error (like `(y - f(x))²`).

Goal: Adjust the **weights** so that this loss becomes as small as possible.

We do this using **gradient descent**:
- Start with random weights.
- Calculate how changing each weight affects the loss (this is the **gradient**).
- Slightly adjust each weight to reduce the loss.
- Repeat many times.

But here’s the challenge:
- With deep networks, there are **too many weights** to compute gradients directly.

So we use a smart trick: **Backpropagation**

---

### 🔁 Backpropagation: The Heart of Training

**Backpropagation** is just **calculus applied efficiently** using the **chain rule**.

It works backwards from the output to the input:

1. Start at the **output layer**.
   - The loss depends directly on the output weights (`V`).
   - Easy to compute gradient of loss w.r.t. `V`.

2. Move to the **last hidden layer** (`W_L`).
   - Loss doesn’t depend directly on `W_L`, but through `V`.
   - So: ∂Loss/∂W_L = (∂Loss/∂V) × (∂V/∂W_L)
   - Reuse the gradient already computed for `V`.

3. Keep going backward:
   - Use previously computed gradients to find new ones.
   - Update `W_{L-1}`, then `W_{L-2}`, ..., all the way to `W₁`.

🔁 This reverse pass is why it’s called **back-propagation**.

It makes training huge networks possible by reusing calculations and avoiding redundant work.

### 💼 Why Neural Networks Matter in Economics

In economics, we often deal with:
- Customer behavior
- Market trends
- Risk assessment
- Forecasting prices, demand, GDP, etc.

Many of these relationships are **not linear** — they involve thresholds, interactions, and complex dependencies.

Example:
- A person’s likelihood to invest may depend non-linearly on income, confidence, interest rates, etc.

So while linear models are simpler, **neural networks give better accuracy** when the true relationship is curved or complicated.

They allow economists to build smarter predictive tools.
