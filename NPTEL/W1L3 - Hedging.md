### Cricket Betting: A Risk-Free Strategy

The lecture starts with a scenario: you have 100 rupees and can bet on a cricket match between India and Australia. There are two people offering different bets:

* **Virat bets on India winning:** He offers a payoff of 25:1 against you, meaning if you bet 1 rupee on Australia and it wins, he pays you 25 rupees.
* **Steve bets on Australia winning:** He offers a payoff of 6:5 against you, meaning if you bet 1 rupee on India and it wins, he pays you 1.20 rupees (6/5).

Initially, you consider betting all your money (100 rupees) on one side. This is a **high-risk** strategy because you could either win big or lose everything.

To reduce this risk, the speaker proposes a different approach: **hedging**. This means betting on both outcomes to secure a profit no matter who wins. By strategically placing a portion of your 100 rupees on each side, you can guarantee a positive return.

The speaker shows that if you bet between 3.85 and 54.55 rupees with Virat (and the rest with Steve), you're guaranteed to make a profit. By doing this, you've completely eliminated your risk of losing money.

This risk-free profit is called an **arbitrage**. It's essentially a loophole where you can make money for sure without any risk. In this example, the maximum guaranteed profit is 102 rupees, which is an amazing return on your initial 100 rupees. The speaker notes that such opportunities are very rare in the real world because the market would quickly correct itself.

### The Risk-Return Trade-Off

While the risk-free profit of 102 rupees is great, what if you're willing to take a little risk for a much bigger reward? The speaker explains that every investor faces this **risk-return trade-off**.

For example, if you're willing to risk losing a maximum of 10 rupees, you can adjust your bets to potentially win a much larger profit, like 1,436 rupees. This decision depends on your personal tolerance for risk.

The speaker also introduces the idea of a **fair bet**, which is a bet where the expected profit is zero. By assuming the people offering the bets believe they are fair, you can calculate the **implied probability** they assign to each team winning.

### Call Options: Hedging in Financial Markets

The second half of the lecture applies these concepts to financial markets using a real-world example: the stock market.

Imagine you want to buy a TCS stock. Its current price is 3,416 rupees. You think the price might drop, but you're also worried it could go up. You don't want to miss out on a good price today.

This is where a **call option** comes in. A call option is a contract that gives you the **right**, but not the obligation, to buy a specific asset (like a TCS stock) at a predetermined price (the **strike price**) on or before a certain date (the **expiration date**).

For a fee (called the premium), you can buy a call option that lets you purchase the TCS stock for 3,416 rupees on a future date.

* If the price of the stock goes up to 3,500, you can still buy it for 3,416 (the strike price) using your call option and make a profit.
* If the price goes down to 3,316, you simply let your option expire and buy the stock on the open market for the lower price.

A call option helps you **mitigate your risk**. You've hedged your bet on the stock price. You're protected from a price increase while still having the chance to benefit from a price drop. The speaker ends the lecture by promising to discuss put options (the right to sell) in the next session.
