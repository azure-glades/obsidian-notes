### Neural Networks: From Linear to Non-Linear Classifiers

#### 1. The Need for Non-Linear Classifiers
* **Limitation of Linear Models:** Linear classifiers work only if data is **linearly separable** (a single line or plane can separate the classes).
* **Real-World Data:** Most real-world data, such as data organized in concentric circles, is not linearly separable.
* **Solution:** **Neural Networks** are a class of models designed to represent and learn complex, non-linear functions to handle such data.

#### 2. The Basic Structure of a Neural Network
* **Core Idea:** A neural network is a graphical representation of a function, inspired by biological neurons.
* **Components:**
    * **Input Layer:** Nodes representing the input features ($x_1, x_2, \dots$).
    * **Output Layer:** A node representing the predicted output or label ($y$).
    * **Edges:** Connections between nodes, each with an associated **weight** ($w$).
* **Operation:** The output node calculates a weighted sum of the inputs and applies a function (e.g., `sign()`) to produce the final output. This is an alternative representation of a linear classifier.

---

#### 3. Expanding to Non-Linearity with Hidden Layers
* **Multilinear Classifiers:** To handle data that requires multiple linear boundaries, a neural network can incorporate **intermediate steps**.
* **Hidden Layers:** "Intermediate steps" are represented by layers of nodes between the input and output layers. These are called **hidden nodes** because they are not part of the input or output.
* **Non-Linear Activation Functions:** To enable the network to learn truly non-linear functions (like a circular boundary), a non-linear activation function ($f$) is applied to the weighted sum at each hidden node. This allows the network to transform the data in a non-linear way.

---

#### 4. The Feedforward Process
* **Architecture:** A neural network consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.
* **Feedforward Flow:**
    1.  Input values are fed into the input layer.
    2.  The weighted sum of these inputs is calculated at the nodes of the first hidden layer, and a non-linear activation function is applied.
    3.  The outputs of the first hidden layer become the inputs for the next hidden layer, and the process repeats.
    4.  This continues layer by layer until the final output is produced. This is called the **feedforward operation**.

---

#### 5. Training a Neural Network
* **Network Parameters:**
    * **Design Choices (by a human engineer):**
        * Number of hidden layers.
        * Number of nodes in each hidden layer.
        * Type of activation functions ($f_1, f_2, \dots, g$).
    * **Learnable Parameters (by the algorithm):**
        * The **edge weights** ($W_1, W_2, \dots$). These are the numerical values that the training process aims to find.
* **Loss Function:** The training process aims to minimize a loss function, which measures the difference between the network's output ($f(x)$) and the true output ($y$).
* **Backpropagation Algorithm:**
    * This is the core algorithm used to train neural networks.
    * It calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to every single weight in the network.
    * It uses the **chain rule of differentiation** to efficiently compute these gradients, starting from the output layer and working backward to the input layer.
    * The weights are then updated using a numerical optimization method like **gradient descent** to minimize the loss.
    * **Key Point:** Deeper networks with millions of parameters require a large amount of training data to be estimated accurately.

---

#### 6. Applications in Economics
* **Non-Linear Classification:** Neural networks can provide more accurate results in economic tasks where the relationship between features and outcomes is non-linear.
* **Forecasting:** In a future lecture, the application of neural networks for time series forecasting will be discussed, which is highly relevant to economics.
* **Complex Prediction Tasks:** These networks can be applied to tasks like financial risk assessment or consumer behavior analysis where linear models are insufficient.

### Keywords and Definitions

* **Feedforward Operation:** "An operation in which the computations are done in layers from the left side to the right side until we reach the output."
* **Backpropagation Algorithm:** "An algorithm in which the weights are updated turn wise from the output layer to the input layer using the chain rule of differentiation."

## Linear vs. Non-Linear Classifiers

### **Linear Classifiers**
- **Definition:** Models that map input features to output labels using a linear function.
- **Basic Equation:** $$ y = \text{sign}(w \cdot x) $$  
  - $$x$$: Input feature vector  
  - $$w$$: Model parameters (weights)  
  - Output ($$y$$): Typically, +1 or -1 for binary classification.
- **Limitation:**  
  - Can only separate data when the relationship between features and labels is linear (“linearly separable”).
  - Many real-world datasets, especially in economics, have non-linear relationships that linear classifiers cannot capture.
- **Implication:**  
  - **Need for models capable of handling non-linearities** to make accurate predictions for complex data.

***

## Basic Neural Network Structure

### **Components of a Simple Neural Network**
- **Input Layer:** Contains nodes, each representing one feature or attribute.
- **Output Layer:** Single node (or several nodes for multi-class/multi-output tasks) predicting the result.
- **Connections (Edges):**  
  - Directed edges connecting inputs to outputs.
  - Each edge carries a **weight** ($$w$$), representing the strength of the connection.
- **Bias Node:**  
  - Dummy node with value 1, connected with its own weight ($$w_0$$) to the output, allowing flexible shifting of decision boundaries.
- **Output Computation:**  
  - Input values are multiplied by their respective weights, summed, added to the bias, and passed through an **activation function** (e.g., sign function for linear classification).

***

## The Transition to Non-Linearity

### **Multi-Linear Classifiers**
- **Idea:**  
  - Combine multiple linear classifiers (e.g., more than one separating line or plane).
  - Used when a single linear boundary is insufficient.
- **Logical Operations:**  
  - Intermediate results are combined using logical **AND**/**OR** functions (e.g., “if either classifier says +1, output is +1”).
- **Neural Network Representation:**  
  - Introduces **hidden nodes** for intermediate computations before combining results at the output.

### **Hidden Layers & Non-Linear Activation Functions**
- **Hidden Layers:**  
  - Extra layers between input and output (“hidden” because their outputs are neither direct inputs nor final predictions).
  - Allow neural networks to compute intermediate steps, greatly increasing their representational power.
- **Non-Linear Activation Functions:**  
  - Replace or supplement simple linear operations.
  - Examples: **Sigmoid**, **ReLU**, **tanh**, or custom functions relevant to the task.
- **Result:**  
  - Neural networks can approximate highly complex, **non-linear relationships**.

## Network Operation and Training

### **Feedforward Process**
- **Definition:**  
  - The procedure by which input data passes sequentially through each layer of the network to produce an output.
- **Steps:**
  - Each node in layer $$l$$ receives the outputs from all nodes in layer $$l-1$$, multiplies them by connection weights, sums the results, adds bias, and applies a non-linear activation function.
  - Computation proceeds from input layer through all hidden layers to the output layer.

### **Types of Parameters**
- **Human-Designed Choices (“Hyperparameters”):**
  - **Number of Hidden Layers ($$L$$)**
  - **Units per Layer ($$d_1, d_2,...$$)**
  - **Activation Functions ($$f_1, f_2,...$$, $$g$$)**
  - Determined by the machine learning engineer based on problem needs.
- **Learned Parameters (“Model Parameters”):**
  - **Weights and Biases ($$W_1, W_2,...$$, $$b_1, b_2,...$$)**
  - Determined during training through algorithms that optimize prediction accuracy.

### **The Role of the Loss Function**
- **Definition:**  
  - A mathematical function ($$L$$) quantifying the error between the predicted output ($$f(x)$$) and the true label ($$y$$).
- **Purpose:**  
  - Guides the training process by indicating how well the neural network is performing.
  - **Common Choices:** Squared error (for regression), cross-entropy (for classification).
- **Design:**  
  - The choice of loss function depends on the specific problem and is set by the engineer.

### **Backpropagation Algorithm**
- **Purpose:**  
  - Efficiently compute how each weight should be adjusted to reduce prediction error (i.e., minimize the loss function).
- **Mechanism:**  
  - Uses the **chain rule of calculus** to compute gradients (partial derivatives) of the loss function with respect to each network parameter, starting from the output and moving backwards layer by layer.
- **Process:**
  - **1. Feedforward:** Compute network outputs.
  - **2. Loss Computation:** Calculate loss using current predictions.
  - **3. Backward Pass (“Backpropagation”):**  
    - Compute gradients layer-wise, first for the output layer, then for each hidden layer recursively.
    - Gradients for deeper layers depend on those already calculated for subsequent layers.
    - Enables efficient training even for networks with millions of parameters.
- **Relationship to Gradient Descent:**
  - **Gradient Descent:** Uses gradients calculated via backpropagation to iteratively update weights and biases, moving towards values that minimize the loss function.
  - Often uses small steps (learning rate), updating parameters until convergence (i.e., until the model stops improving).
