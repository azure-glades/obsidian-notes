### 🌟 **Lecture 6: Unconstrained Optimization in AI for Economics – Simple Explanation**

#### 👋 Introduction
The professor, Addoi Mitro, starts by saying:
> “So far, we’ve seen how AI can be used in economics — like predicting prices or analyzing markets. Now, we’re going to dive into the *methods* behind AI itself — especially *optimization*, which is one of the most important tools in AI.”

He explains that **optimization** means:  
> “Finding the *best possible choice* out of many options — like spending money, choosing routes, or dividing resources — so that you get the *maximum benefit* or *minimum loss*.”

Today’s lecture covers:
1. How to write an optimization problem in economics.
2. What convex and non-convex functions are.
3. What unconstrained optimization means and how to solve it using **gradient descent**.
4. What happens when you have **multiple goals** (multi-objective optimization) — and what **Pareto optimality** means.

Let’s go step by step.

### 💰 1. The Basic Economic Problem: Spending Your Budget Wisely

Imagine you’re the government, and you have **₹100 crore** to spend. You want to spend it on **two things**:  
- **Education** (Sector 1)  
- **Healthcare** (Sector 2)

You can’t spend more than ₹100 crore total.  
You decide to spend **x crore** on education → then **(100 – x) crore** goes to healthcare.

Now, each sector gives you some **benefit** (or “outcome”) based on how much you spend:
- Let’s say **f₁(x)** = benefit from spending `x` on education (e.g., number of students graduating)
- Let’s say **f₂(100 – x)** = benefit from spending `(100 – x)` on healthcare (e.g., average life expectancy)

👉 Both benefits are measured in numbers — like “how many people graduate?” or “how long do people live?”  
Even though these are complex things, economists use these numbers as **proxies** (stand-ins) to measure success.

So your **total benefit (utility)** is:  
> **f(x) = f₁(x) + f₂(100 – x)**

Your goal?  
> **Choose the best value of `x` (how much to spend on education) so that this total benefit `f(x)` is as HIGH as possible.**

This is called an **optimization problem**:  
> **Maximize f(x)** — find the `x` that makes the sum biggest.

💡 **Important Note**:  
Sometimes, a higher number is *bad*. For example:
- If your indicator for defense is “number of terrorist attacks,” you want that number to be **low**.
- But if your indicator is “life expectancy,” you want it **high**.

✅ No problem! Just flip the sign:  
If you want to *minimize* something bad, just make it **negative** → then minimizing the negative = maximizing the original.

So, **all problems can be turned into minimization problems**.  
→ Maximize f(x) becomes → Minimize **–f(x)**

That’s why in AI, we almost always talk about **minimization** — it’s easier to standardize.

### 📈 2. Making It Harder: Multiple Variables & Budget Constraints

Now let’s make the problem more realistic.

Instead of forcing yourself to spend *all* ₹100 crore, you now realize:  
> “Maybe I don’t need to spend all of it. Maybe spending only ₹80 crore gives me almost the same benefit, and I save ₹20 crore!”

So now, you have **two variables**:
- `x₁` = amount spent on education
- `x₂` = amount spent on healthcare

And your total spending must be **≤ ₹100 crore**:  
> **x₁ + x₂ ≤ 100**

Your total benefit is still:  
> **f(x₁, x₂) = f₁(x₁) + f₂(x₂)**

Now your job is:  
> Find values of `x₁` and `x₂` such that `f(x₁, x₂)` is as big as possible, while keeping `x₁ + x₂ ≤ 100`.

This is called a **multivariable optimization problem**.

#### 🎯 What Do Solutions Look Like?

Imagine you plot `x₁` on the X-axis and `x₂` on the Y-axis.

Every point `(x₁, x₂)` is a way to split your budget.

Some splits give you a total benefit of 10.  
Others give you 15.  
Others give you 20.

Now, connect all points that give you the **same total benefit** (say, 15).  
These lines are called **indifference curves**.

> 💬 “I’m indifferent” between spending (3, 12) or (5, 10) if both give me the same total benefit.

So:
- Each curve = same level of happiness/benefit.
- Higher curves = better outcomes.
- Your goal: reach the **highest possible indifference curve** without breaking the budget rule (`x₁ + x₂ ≤ 100`).

This is visual thinking — very powerful!

### 🔢 3. Solving Optimization Problems: Two Ways

There are two ways to solve optimization problems:

#### ✅ Method 1: Calculus (Analytical Solution) — School Math!

If your function `f(x)` is smooth and has a derivative (like a curve you can draw without lifting your pen), you can use **calculus**.

Example:  
You want to maximize `f(x) = f₁(x) + f₂(100 – x)`

Take its derivative → set it equal to zero → solve for `x`.

Like in high school:  
If `f(x) = x² – 4x + 4`, then derivative = `2x – 4`.  
Set `2x – 4 = 0` → `x = 2` → that’s the minimum!

In multivariable case:  
Take partial derivatives with respect to `x₁` and `x₂`, set both to zero → solve two equations → get optimal `x₁` and `x₂`.

BUT…

⚠️ **Problem**: This doesn’t always work!

Why?
- The function might not be smooth (has sharp corners).
- The derivative equation might be impossible to solve algebraically.
- There could be thousands of variables → too hard to solve by hand.

So we need another method...

---

#### ✅ Method 2: Gradient Descent (Numerical Solution) — AI’s Favorite Tool

This is the **core algorithm** used in AI (like training neural networks).

It’s an **iterative** method — meaning you start somewhere, then take small steps toward improvement.

##### 🧠 How It Works:

You want to **minimize** a function `f(x)`.

Start at a random point `x₀` (your first guess).

Then repeat this forever:
> **x₁ = x₀ – α × (derivative of f at x₀)**

Where:
- `α` = learning rate (a small positive number like 0.1 or 0.01)
- Derivative = slope of the function at current point

##### 🚶‍♂️ Think of It Like Walking Down a Hill Blindfolded

- You feel the ground under your feet → sense the **slope**.
- If the ground slopes downward to your left → step left.
- If it slopes downward to your right → step right.
- How big a step? That’s `α`.

You keep stepping until you stop moving → you’ve reached a bottom.

That bottom is a **local minimum**.

##### 📊 Example: Minimizing `f(x) = x² – 4x + 4`

We know the answer is `x = 2` (where f(x)=0).

But suppose you start at `x₀ = 5`.

Derivative = `2x – 4` → at x=5 → derivative = 6  
Pick α = 0.1

New x = 5 – 0.1×6 = 4.4  
New x = 4.4 – 0.1×(2×4.4 – 4) = 4.4 – 0.1×4.8 = 3.92  
Next: 3.92 – 0.1×(3.84) ≈ 3.54  
...  
After many steps → you reach x=2 → derivative = 0 → you stop.

✅ You found the minimum!

##### ⚠️ But What If You Take Too Big a Step?

If α is too large (say, α=2):

Start at x=5 → derivative=6 → new x = 5 – 2×6 = 5 – 12 = –7  
Now at x=–7, derivative = 2×(–7) – 4 = –18 → new x = –7 – 2×(–18) = –7 + 36 = 29  
Now you jump from –7 to 29 → then back again → you never settle down → **you never converge!**

➡️ So:  
- **Too big α** → jumps over minimum → oscillates → **no convergence**  
- **Too small α** → takes forever → but will eventually reach minimum

##### 🔄 In Multiple Dimensions (Many Variables)

Suppose you have `x = [x₁, x₂, x₃]` — three variables.

You calculate the **gradient** — a vector of all partial derivatives:
> ∇f = [df/dx₁, df/dx₂, df/dx₃]

Then update all at once:
> x_new = x_old – α × ∇f

Or you can update one variable at a time:
1. Fix x₂ and x₃ → change x₁ until best
2. Fix x₁ and x₃ → change x₂ until best
3. Fix x₁ and x₂ → change x₃ until best
4. Repeat until nothing changes much → done!

This is called **coordinate descent** — simpler and often good enough.

### 🤔 4. What Are Convex and Non-Convex Functions?

This is super important for knowing if gradient descent will work well.

#### ✅ Convex Function = Bowl Shape

A function is **convex** if:
> Between any two points on the graph, the line connecting them lies **above** the function.

Think of a U-shaped bowl:  
- Any two points → straight line between them is above the curve.  
- Only **one lowest point** (global minimum).

Examples:  
- f(x) = x²  
- f(x) = |x| (even though not smooth, still convex)

✅ **Good news**:  
- Gradient descent **will always** find the global minimum if the function is convex.  
- No matter where you start — you’ll end up at the bottom.

#### ❌ Non-Convex Function = Bumpy Landscape

Has many hills and valleys.

Example: f(x) = sin(x) + 0.1x² — wavy shape with many dips.

Here, there are:
- **Local minima**: low points, but not the lowest overall
- **Global minimum**: the absolute lowest point

Gradient descent can get stuck in a local minimum!

Example:  
You start near a small valley → you think you’re at the bottom → but there’s a deeper valley nearby.

➡️ So if you start at different places, you might end up at different minima.

💡 **Solution?**  
Run gradient descent **many times**, starting from **many different initial points**.  
Then pick the **best result** among all runs → hope it’s the global minimum.

This is called **multi-start gradient descent**.

---

### 🔄 5. Newton-Raphson Method — A Faster Alternative

This is another method to find minima — faster than gradient descent, but trickier.

Instead of just using the slope (gradient), it also uses the **curvature** (second derivative).

Update rule:
> **x₁ = x₀ – (function) \* (inverse of derivative)**
	

✅ Pros:
- Usually converges faster than gradient descent.

❌ Cons:
- Needs inverse of 1st derivative → harder to compute.
- In multiple dimensions, first derivative becomes a matrix called the **Hessian**.
- Finding the inverse of a big Hessian matrix is **computationally expensive** → slow or even impossible for huge problems.

So:  
- Use Newton-Raphson for small problems with few variables.  
- Use gradient descent for big ones (like deep learning).

### 🎯 6. Multi-Objective Optimization — When You Have More Than One Goal

Now imagine you’re not just trying to maximize one thing — you have **two or more goals** that conflict.

#### 🛫 Real-Life Example: Choosing a Flight

You want to fly from City A to City B.  
You have 6 flight options:

| Airline    | Time (hrs) | Cost (₹ thousands) |
|------------|------------|---------------------|
| Indigo     | 2          | 8                   |
| GoAir      | 3          | 8                   |
| Vistara    | 4          | 6                   |
| AirAsia    | 5          | 4                   |
| Jet Airways| 5          | 7                   |
| Kingfisher | 6          | 9                   |

You want to:
- Minimize **time** ✅
- Minimize **cost** ✅

But you can’t minimize both at once!

Look at comparisons:

- **Indigo vs GoAir**: Same cost, Indigo is faster → **Indigo wins**
- **GoAir vs Vistara**: GoAir is faster, but more expensive → **No clear winner**
- **AirAsia vs Kingfisher**: AirAsia is faster AND cheaper → **AirAsia dominates Kingfisher**

#### ➡️ Key Idea: Dominance

A solution **A dominates** solution **B** if:
- A is **at least as good** as B on **all** objectives
- And **strictly better** on **at least one**

Example:  
AirAsia (5h, ₹4k) vs Kingfisher (6h, ₹9k)  
→ AirAsia is better on time AND cost → So AirAsia **dominates** Kingfisher.

Similarly, AirAsia dominates Jet Airways (same time, cheaper) → dominates.

But:  
GoAir (3h, ₹8k) vs Vistara (4h, ₹6k)  
→ GoAir better on time, Vistara better on cost → **Neither dominates the other**

#### ✅ Pareto Optimal Solution

A solution is **Pareto optimal** if **no other solution dominates it**.

So in our table:
- AirAsia: not dominated by anyone → Pareto optimal
- Indigo: not dominated → Pareto optimal
- GoAir: not dominated → Pareto optimal
- Vistara: not dominated → Pareto optimal
- Jet Airways: dominated by AirAsia → NOT Pareto optimal
- Kingfisher: dominated by AirAsia → NOT Pareto optimal

So the **Pareto optimal set** = {AirAsia, Indigo, GoAir, Vistara}

These are your **best choices** — no other option is strictly better.

#### 🏔️ Pareto Front

Plot all solutions on a graph:
- X-axis: Time
- Y-axis: Cost

Each airline is a dot.

The **outermost dots** that form the “lower-left boundary” — those are the Pareto optimal ones.

This boundary is called the **Pareto front**.

It shows the **trade-off**:  
> “To save ₹1k, you’ll have to wait 1 extra hour.”  
> “To save 1 hour, you’ll have to pay ₹2k more.”

You can’t improve one without hurting the other.

#### 🌐 Why Is This Important in Economics?

This isn’t just about flights!

- **Government budgeting**: Spend on education vs health vs defense → trade-offs everywhere.
- **International trade**: Country A is good at making cars, Country B at making rice → each should specialize → trade → everyone benefits.
- **Income redistribution**: Take money from rich and give to poor → but don’t make rich people worse off than before → Pareto improvement.
- **Social welfare**: Improve overall happiness without hurting anyone.

Pareto optimality helps us find **fair and efficient** decisions.

#### 🔁 How Do We Solve Multi-Objective Problems?

One common trick:  
Turn multiple goals into **one single goal** using **weights**.

Example:  
You have two goals:  
- Minimize time → f₁  
- Minimize cost → f₂  

Create a **weighted sum**:  
> **Total Score = w₁ × f₁ + w₂ × f₂**

Where:
- w₁ = weight on time (e.g., 0.6)
- w₂ = weight on cost (e.g., 0.4)

Then minimize this single score.

But here’s the catch:  
Different weights → different Pareto solutions.

- High w₁ → you care more about time → pick fast flights
- High w₂ → you care more about cost → pick cheap flights

By changing weights, you can **explore the entire Pareto front**.

This is called the **weighted sum method**.

Another advanced method: **NSGA-II** (used in AI) — finds diverse Pareto solutions automatically.

### 🧠 Final Thoughts (Professor’s Message)

> “We started with a simple budget problem. We learned how to model it mathematically. We saw how to solve it using calculus and numerical methods. We saw how real-world problems have multiple goals — and how we use Pareto optimality to handle trade-offs fairly. This is the foundation of AI in economics.”

Next lecture: **Constrained Optimization** — what if you have strict rules like “you MUST spend at least ₹20 crore on education”? Then we use Lagrange multipliers and other tools.
