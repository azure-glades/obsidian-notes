### 🎓 **Lecture 38: Computer Vision for Economics – Explained Simply**

This is the **final week** of an AI course focused on economics, taught by **Professor Adya Mitra** from **IIT Kharagpur**. In this last major lecture (Lecture 38), she talks about how **computer vision**, a branch of artificial intelligence, can be used in **economics research**.

Let’s go step-by-step through what was covered:

---

## 🔹 Part 1: What is Computer Vision?

### ✅ Simple Definition:
> **Computer vision = Teaching computers to "see" and understand images like humans do.**

Just like our eyes capture light and our brain interprets what we’re seeing, computer vision uses algorithms so that machines can analyze pictures or videos and make sense of them.

---

### 🖼️ How Are Images Stored in Computers?
- An image is stored as a **matrix** (a grid of numbers).
- This matrix has **three dimensions**:  
  - **Height (m)** – number of rows  
  - **Width (n)** – number of columns  
  - **Channels (l)** – color layers

#### Channels:
- If `l = 1` → **Grayscale image** (black and white)
- If `l = 3` → **Color image** with three channels: **Red, Green, Blue (RGB)**

Each small square in the image is called a **pixel**. Each pixel has a value between **0 and 255**:
- **0 = very dark (black)**
- **255 = very bright (white)**

For example:
- A pixel with high red value (say 240) but low green/blue values looks **red**.
- A pixel with all three colors at medium levels might look **gray or yellow**, depending on balance.

So, every image is just a big 3D box of numbers!

---

## 🔹 Part 2: Main Tasks in Computer Vision

There are several key things computers try to do with images. Let’s break them down simply:

---

### 🧩 Task 1: Image Classification
> “What is in this picture?”

The goal is to **label the whole image** based on what objects are present.

📌 Example:  
An image shows **3 sheep and 1 dog**.  
A computer might say:
- Sheep: 60% chance
- Dog: 30% chance
- Other: 10%

It doesn’t tell *where* they are—just gives probabilities for each possible class.

🧠 Like giving a multiple-choice test to the computer: “Is this a cat? A dog? A car?” And it picks the best answer(s).

How does it work?
- First, convert the image into a **feature vector** (a long list of useful numbers summarizing the image).
- Then feed this vector into a **classifier** (like a decision tree, SVM, or neural network).
- The classifier outputs either:
  - One label (e.g., “dog”), OR
  - A probability distribution over labels (e.g., 60% sheep, 30% dog...)

💡 Challenge: How do we get good features from the image?

---

### 🟦 Task 2: Object Detection
> “Where are the objects in this image—and what are they?”

Now the computer not only identifies objects but also **draws boxes around them**.

📌 Example: Detecting human faces in a crowd → put a rectangle around each face.

Important points:
- Objects can appear in **different sizes** (small baby face vs large adult face).
- They can be **tilted or rotated**.
- So the system must check **many regions** of the image at **different scales**.

🔍 Method:
- Slide a window across the image.
- For each region, ask: “Does this contain a dog?” → Yes/No.
- Try many window sizes and positions.
- When one region says “Yes,” expand or adjust the box to find the full object.

Eventually, it draws precise **bounding boxes** with confidence scores.

🎯 Think of playing "Where’s Waldo?" — scanning every part of the page carefully until you spot him.

---

### 🟨 Task 3: Image Segmentation
> “Color each pixel according to which object it belongs to.”

Instead of drawing boxes, segmentation assigns **labels to individual pixels**.

Two types:

#### 1. Semantic Segmentation:
- All sheep → labeled same way (e.g., all colored blue)
- All dogs → another color (e.g., red)

But different sheep aren't separated from each other.

#### 2. Instance Segmentation:
- Every single sheep gets its own unique label.
- So now you know: “This is Sheep #1”, “That is Sheep #2”

🧠 Analogy:
- Semantic = Coloring all trees green
- Instance = Giving each tree a name tag

Segmentation is like **pixel-level clustering** — grouping together pixels that belong to the same thing.

Clues used:
- Neighboring pixels often belong to the same object
- Pixels with similar colors/textures likely go together

---

## 🔹 Part 3: Feature Representation – The Core Problem

Why is feature extraction so important?

Because raw pixels (the 0–255 numbers) are messy and don’t directly tell us about meaning.

Imagine trying to recognize a cat just by looking at millions of random RGB values — impossible!

So we need **better representations**.

---

### ❌ Why Not Use Raw Pixels Directly?
Two big problems:
1. **Loss of spatial info**: When you flatten an image into a vector, neighboring pixels may end up far apart — breaking location relationships.
2. **Too much noise**: Pixel values include shadows, lighting changes, tiny details — irrelevant for understanding content.

We want **robust features** that ignore unimportant variations and focus on real patterns.

---

### 🛠️ Traditional Approach: Hand-Crafted Features
Before deep learning, researchers manually designed **filters** (also called masks) to detect patterns like:
- Edges (sharp changes in brightness)
- Corners
- Textures (repeating patterns)

Filters work by sliding over the image and responding strongly where a specific pattern matches.

Example: A filter shaped like a vertical line will respond when it finds vertical edges.

But designing these filters is hard:
- You have to guess which patterns matter.
- Real-world images vary too much (lighting, angle, etc.)
- Representing detected edges mathematically as input for models is tricky.

Despite decades of effort, results were limited.

---

### 💡 Revolution: Deep Learning & Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Everything changed after **2012**, when deep learning took over computer vision.

With CNNs:
- Instead of humans creating filters...
- The **neural network learns the best filters during training!**

Here’s how:
- Each layer applies multiple filters automatically.
- These filters create **feature maps** — new images highlighting useful patterns (edges, corners, textures, shapes, etc.).
- Later layers combine early features into complex ones (e.g., wheels → cars).

🧠 It’s like teaching a student:
- At first, they learn basic lines and curves.
- Then they start recognizing eyes, ears, noses.
- Finally, they identify full animals or objects.

Best part? No manual design needed. The model figures out what to look for from data.

---

## 🔹 Part 4: Applying Computer Vision to Economics

Now comes the exciting part: **Can we use computer vision to study economic conditions?**

Yes! Especially in places where traditional data (like income surveys) are missing or outdated.

We use two main sources of visual data:

---

### 🗺️ Source 1: Google Street View Images
- Taken by cars driving around cities/villages.
- Show roads, buildings, vehicles, shops, infrastructure.
- Can reveal signs of wealth (nice houses, clean streets) or poverty (shacks, dirt roads).

👉 Idea: Train AI to classify neighborhoods as rich/poor based on street views.

---

### 🛰️ Source 2: Satellite Imagery
- Taken from space — covers huge areas at once.
- Available globally, even remote regions.

But satellite images come in many forms:
- **Optical band** (visible light): Looks like regular photos — you can see buildings, roads, farms.
- **Other bands** (infrared, thermal): Invisible to human eye — require special processing.

Even if we can’t directly see “income,” we can find **proxy variables** — measurable things that correlate with economic development.

---

## 🔍 Proxy Variables in Economic Studies

These are indirect indicators that suggest economic well-being.

### 1. 🌿 NDVI – Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
- Measures **greenness** in satellite pixels.
- High NDVI = lots of plants/foliage.
- Could mean:
  - Agricultural land (good sign of rural economy), OR
  - Forests (not necessarily linked to wealth)

Used to distinguish farmland from urban areas.

---

### 2. 🏘️ Built-Up Area Index
- Identifies man-made structures: buildings, roads, paved surfaces.
- More built-up area → more development.

Can be found using object detection or texture analysis.

---

### 3. 💡 Nighttime Lights (Most Important!)
> Brighter = richer; Darker = poorer

At night, satellites take pictures showing lights from:
- Cities
- Houses
- Factories
- Roads

Dark areas usually mean:
- Rural zones
- Forests
- Poor communities without electricity

💡 Key insight: **Light intensity correlates strongly with economic activity.**

You can literally **see GDP from space**!

---

## 🔎 Research Papers Discussed

Now let’s look at **five recent studies** that apply computer vision to economics.

---

### 📘 Paper 1: *"Are Nighttime Lights Good Proxies for Economic Activity in Rural Colombia?"*

📍 Focus: Rural areas in **Colombia (South America)**

🔎 What did they do?
- Used **nighttime light data** from satellites.
- Compared light intensity with actual **Regional Domestic Product (RDP)** at the municipal level (like towns/districts).
- Used statistical models (regression) to test correlation.

✅ Findings:
- Strong link between **light brightness** and **economic output**.
- Even works in **rural areas** of developing countries.
- Best results came from **VIIRS sensor data** (a type of satellite tech).

🔑 Takeaway: Night lights are reliable proxies for local economic development.

---

### 📘 Paper 2: *"Poverty from Space: Using High-Resolution Satellite Imagery in Sri Lanka"*

📍 Focus: Estimating **poverty and consumption levels** in **Sri Lanka**

🔎 Methods:
- Used **high-resolution satellite images** (from DigitalGlobe).
- Extracted two kinds of features:
  1. **Object-based**: Detected cars, buildings, roads
  2. **Texture-based**: Analyzed surface roughness, patterns

📊 Ground Truth:
- Poverty rates and average spending came from **census data** (surveys done on the ground).
- But surveys are expensive → only available for some areas.

🛠️ Process:
1. Match satellite images with known economic data (from census).
2. Train ML models to learn patterns (e.g., rich areas have more cars, better roads).
3. Apply model to new areas **without survey data**.

🎯 Features Used:
- Nighttime lights
- Building density
- Road networks
- Car density
- Agricultural land (paddy fields)
- Shadows (indicate building height)
- Vegetation

✅ Result:
- Models could accurately predict poverty levels using only satellite images.
- Rich vs poor areas showed clear differences in visual features.

---

### 📘 Paper 3: *"Using Public Satellite Imagery and Deep Learning to Understand Wealth in Africa"*

📍 Goal: Map **asset wealth** across African countries.

💰 What is Asset Wealth?
- Based on household items/surroundings:
  - Quality of house floor (dirt vs tile)
  - Access to water
  - Ownership of phone, TV, radio

🧾 Ground truth again came from **household surveys**.

🛰️ Data Sources:
- Nighttime lights
- Multispectral imagery (beyond visible light)

🧠 AI Model:
- Used **deep learning (CNNs)** like ResNet architecture.
- Trained to predict wealth index from images.

🔄 Multiple predictions made from different image types:
- One from nighttime lights
- One from daytime multispectral images
- Combine or compare them to pick the most accurate estimate

✅ Outcome:
- Predictions matched real survey data reasonably well.
- Shows potential for continent-wide poverty mapping.

---

### 📘 Paper 4: *"Transfer Learning from Deep Features for Remote Sensing and Poverty Mapping"*

🚀 Big Challenge: Models trained in one country may fail in another.

Why?
- Urban slums in India look different from deserts in Niger.
- Data distribution shifts → model performance drops.

🔧 Solution: **Transfer Learning**

🧠 What is Transfer Learning?
- Train a model on data from **Region A** (with good survey + satellite data).
- Then **fine-tune or adapt** it for **Region B** (where only satellite data exists).

🔧 Like teaching someone French in Paris, then sending them to Quebec — they already know the basics but adjust to local accents.

✅ Benefits:
- Saves time and money (don’t retrain from scratch).
- Makes models portable across geographies.

Used here to map poverty in underserved regions using pre-trained CNN features.

---

### 📘 Paper 5: Additional References
Prof. Mitra lists **five recent papers** (she mentions five total). All explore similar themes:
- Using satellite images
- Extracting features via AI
- Predicting economic indicators
- Validating against ground-truth surveys

She encourages students to read all five to deeply understand how **AI meets economics**.
