Economies can be arranged in many different ways

# Capitalist Economy
An economic system where production and consumption are driven by economic incentives, in a free market.
Features:
1. Right to private property: Factors of production are under private ownership
2. Freedom of choice: Consumers can freely choose and spend their money freely
3. Profit motive: Economics activity is driven by an entrepreneur's need to make money
4. Self-interest: People are guided by self-interest to make profit
5. Competition breeds innovation: In a free-market, consumers choose the best/optimal goods/service. This incentivises people to innovate to make better or superior goods/services
6. Minimal Government interference: The Government is only involved in maintaining law & order
7. Price mechanism: Prices of goods are stabilized by supply/demand

Benefits:
1. Flexible/adaptable - quickly adjusts to changes in environment or market
2. Innovation - competition breeds innovation
3. Entrepreneurship is encouraged
4. Decentralization of economic power - no single institution has complete control
5. High standard of living due to innovation and access to money
6. Optimum use of resources driven by a need to maximize profit
7. High rate of capital formation

Issues
1. Income disparity: There is widespread gap of income between the rich and poor
2. Exploitation of labour: Profit motive and self-interest causes low wages for workers
3. Unbalanced economic activity: different parts of the world grow at different and uneven rates resulting in uneven distribution of wealth
4. Negative externalities: Decisions by companies can cause negative impact on other firms or households. Companies will not care for these externalities. Ex: Consequences of pollution is experienced by general population
# Socialist/Command Economy
An economic system where the means of production and distribution are controlled by the state.
Features:
1. Collective ownership: society owns all factors of production
2. Centralized planning: The state plans economic development which takes away some freedom of choice but results in more even distribution of welfare
3. Equality of income: Since there is no notion of private property, there is no extreme accumulation of wealth. Hence income and wealth is more evenly distributed
4. Maximum social welfare because wealth generation is controlled and distributed by society
5. Greater role of the state: The state/society has complete control of economic activity

Benefits:
1. Workers rights: Exploitation of workers or consumers is not possible
2. Elimination of wealth inequality, more even distribution of wealth
3. Better overall social welfare and quality of living
4. No waste of resources caused by unhealthy competition
5. More balanced economic growth due to regulation and planning

Issues:
1. Absence of incentives for hardwork. Since no personal wealth exists, there is no motive for people to be productive to the state.
2. Slow economic growth due to bureaucracy. Distribution of capital is planned out hence all sectors grow slowly. Improper planning can also hinder growth
3. Complete state control makes way for corruption
4. No automatic price determination. All price is set by the government which may not reflect real supply-demand
# Mixed Economy
A combination of the capitalist and socialist economic system where both private and public sectors exist and interact.
Features:
1. Coexistence of private and public systems: both for-profit and non-profits exist and interact
2. Economic welfare: Public sector provides wider economic benefits and more even wealth distribution while private sector drives innovation. Government regulation prevents exploitation by corps
3. Economic planning: The Government plays a key role in regulating growth. Government spending and planning controls the direction and spread of development. Proper economic planning can result in better growth than capitalist systems
4. Price mechanism exists to stabilize costs
5. Economic freedom of individuals exists. This breeds entrepreneurship and self-interest to gain wealth

Benefits:
1. Government regulation prevents exploitation of labour
2. Social welfare and wealth distribution: Regulation prevents huge accumulation of wealth. Wealth is redistributed through public sector, welfare schemes and policy.
3. Individual rights, private property and price mechanism ensures self-interest and wealth remain as the main motivators for entrepreneurship. This encourages competition and breeds innovation
4. Rapid and planned economic development due to government intervention can cause faster economic growth than purely capitalist systems

Issues:
1. Economic fluctuations: Public and private sectors react differently to market changes which can cause unemployment
2. Inefficiency: Government involvement can hinder or disrupt growth and functioning of private sector and firms
3. Corruption and black markets: Government officials are prone to corruption. Unregulated markets are setup to avoid government control
