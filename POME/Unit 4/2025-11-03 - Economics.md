Economics is the study of resource allocation to meet human needs.
2 Basic assumptions:
- Resources are limited
- Human demands are unlimited

# Truth and Ideal
Positive Analysis: Economics of facts
- Describes the world as it is.
- Considers real economic situations and describes them, to know what caused it, what is the reasoning, what it would cause in the future
Normative Analysis: Economics of opinion
- Describes the world as it should be.
- Considers ideal economic situations, what decisions could do, what would be solutions, what is ideal answers to problems.
# Reasoning in economics
Reasoning is used to arrive on generalizations or specific answers to problems in economics. To make theories etc.
1. Inductive reasoning: Start from specific facts and generalize to the whole. Induce the whole truth from known facts
2. Deductive reasoning: start from general truths and identify whether a specific case is true or false. Deduce facts from known theories/information
# Key Concepts
### Scarcity
Scarcity is the foundational concept in economics. It means that there are not enough resources to satisfy all human wants. Because of scarcity, individuals and firms must make **trade-offs/choices**.
### Trade-off or Choice
Since not all needs can be met cuz of lack of resources, people need to choose/decide what output is best from what is available
### Opportunity Cost
Opportunity cost is the cost of missing out on other opportunity. The **opportunity cost** of a choice is the value of the next best alternative that is forgone. For example:
- If you spend an hour studying economics instead of working a part-time job that pays $15, your opportunity cost is $15.
- A farmer who uses land to grow wheat gives up the chance to grow corn-that forgone corn is the opportunity cost.
### Demand
- **Demand** refers to the quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to buy at various prices during a given period.
- The **Law of Demand**: All else equal, as the price of a good rises, the quantity demanded falls, and vice versa.
- Demand is influenced by:
	  - Consumer income
	  - Prices of related goods (substitutes and complements)
	  - Tastes and preferences
	  - Expectations about future prices
	  - Number of buyers
### Supply
- **Supply** is the quantity of a good that producers are willing and able to sell at various prices.
- The **Law of Supply**: All else equal, as price rises, the quantity supplied increases, and vice versa.
- Factors affecting supply include:
	  - Cost of production (e.g., wages, raw materials)
	  - Technology
	  - Prices of related goods
	  - Producer expectations
	  - Number of sellers
### Market Equilibrium
- **Equilibrium** occurs where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.
- The corresponding price is called the **equilibrium price** (or market-clearing price), and the quantity is the **equilibrium quantity**.
- If price is above equilibrium → **surplus** (excess supply).
- If price is below equilibrium → **shortage** (excess demand).
- Markets tend to move toward equilibrium through price adjustments.

> **Example**: In the market for electric scooters, if demand surges due to a new eco-friendly trend, the price rises temporarily, encouraging more producers to enter the market until a new equilibrium is reached.
