The Law of Demand states that, all other factors being equal (**ceteris paribus**), as the price of a good or service **rises**, the quantity demanded of that good or service **falls**, and conversely, as the price **falls**, the quantity demanded **rises**

The Law of Supply states that, all other factors being equal (**ceteris paribus**), as the price of a good or service **rises**, the quantity supplied of that good or service **rises**, and conversely, as the price **falls**, the quantity supplied **falls**.

# Price Elasticity
**Price Elasticity** is a measure of the responsiveness of one variable to a change in another. In the context of markets, it is most commonly used to refer to **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)** or **Price Elasticity of Supply (PES)**

PED measures how sensitive the quantity demanded is to a change in price. 
$$PED= \frac{\text{\% Change in Quantity Demanded}}{\text{\% Change in Price}}​$$ 
$$PES= \frac{\text{\% Change in Quantity Supplied}}{\text{\% Change in Price}}​$$

Elasticity < 1 -> low responsiveness, price does not control the amount supplied or demanded all that much
Elasticity > 1 -> high responsiveness, small change in price will cause big change in amount supplied or demanded

Mid-point method
$$\text{PED} = \left| \frac{\frac{Q_2 - Q_1}{(Q_2 + Q_1) / 2}}{\frac{P_2 - P_1}{(P_2 + P_1) / 2}} \right|$$
Where
$$\text{Percent Change in Quantity} = \frac{Q_2 - Q_1}{(Q_2 + Q_1) / 2}$$

$$\text{Percent Change in Price} = \frac{P_2 - P_1}{(P_2 + P_1) / 2}$$
