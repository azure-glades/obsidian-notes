Theory - A logical set of conclusions that is proved to be true
Model - Empirical, applied version of theory

Circular flow model is a highly simplified version of the economy that shows the flow of goods, resources and money in the economy. It has 2 entities : Firms and Households
It assumes a closed economy (no government or foreign trade)

Households
- Spend money to buy goods & services
- Are paid money for resources, labor, land and capital (Sell in factor/resources market)
Firms
- Spend money on labor, land and capital to make goods & services
- Are paid money for their goods & services (sell in product market)

### Two Key Markets
The model revolves around two interconnected markets:
1. **Product Market**  
   - **What flows**: Goods and services **from firms to households**.  
   - **Money flow**: Households **pay money** to firms in exchange for products.  
   - Firms earn **revenue** from these sales.

2. **Factor (Resource) Market**  
   - **What flows**: Factors of production (land, labor, capital, entrepreneurship) **from households to firms**.  
   - **Money flow**: Firms **pay households** for these resources in the form of:
     - Wages (for labor)
     - Rent (for land)
     - Interest (for capital)
     - Profit (for entrepreneurship)
   - Households earn **income** from these payments.
### The Circular Flow
- **Real flow** (physical): Resources → Firms → Goods & Services → Households → (back to firms via consumption).
- **Money flow** (monetary): Income → Households → Expenditure → Firms → Revenue → (back to households as income).

> Money flows in a circle. Total Expenditure = Total production = Total GDP

> Leakage : Withdrawl from the flow
> Injection : Entry into the flow
### The Government
In real life, the government injects money and also leaks money into the flow.
- Money leaks to the govt from houses and firms through **taxes**
- Money is injected by the govt into firms and houses through govt spending and programmes
> Savings + Taxes = Govt spending + Investment
### Foreign Trade
In real life, trade happens between economies. This injects and leaks resources
- Imports leak money out of the economy (houses and firms import resources by paying money)
- Exports inject money into the economy (firms export resources and are paid money)
### Financial Institutions
Financial institutions help redistribute resources and money to increase economic output
- **Savings** are a leakage from the flow since they aren't used.
- Banks collect and inject these savings back into the market through **investments**
