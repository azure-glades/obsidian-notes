POSDCORB is a classic acronym in the field of public administration and management, introduced by **Luther Gulick** in the 1930s as part of the **Classical Management Theory**. It outlines the **seven key functions of management**:

**POSDCORB** stands for:
1. **P – Planning**  
   Determining what needs to happen in the future—setting goals, strategies, and action plans.
2. **O – Organizing**  
   Structuring resources (human, financial, material) and tasks to implement the plan effectively.
3. **S – Staffing**  
   Recruiting, hiring, training, and retaining the right people for the right roles.
4. **D – Directing**  
   Leading, guiding, and supervising employees to achieve organizational goals (includes decision-making and motivation).
5. **CO – Coordinating**  
   Harmonizing activities and efforts across departments or teams to ensure unity and efficiency.
6. **R – Reporting**  
   Keeping stakeholders informed through records, communication, and feedback (sometimes called "information management").
7. **B – Budgeting**  
   Managing fiscal planning, accounting, and control of financial resources.

### Historical Context:
POSDCORB emerged from the **administrative management school** of thought, influenced by thinkers like Henri Fayol. It was widely used in government and bureaucratic organizations to bring structure and efficiency to public administration.

### Modern Relevance:
While POSDCORB is considered somewhat rigid or outdated in today’s agile and adaptive management environments, it remains foundational in understanding the core responsibilities of administrative leadership—especially in public sector and large hierarchical organizations.
