A set of experiments to study employee behaviour done in the 1930s

# Illumination experiment
Found that light levels does not affect productivity that much
# Relay assembly test room study
Found that social relationship among workers, involvement in decisio making etc had bigger effect on productivity than working conditions
# Mass interviewing programme
Found that productivity can be increased if workers can freely talk and discuss matters important to them
# Bank wiring observation room experiment
Found that when pay is linked to overall productivity, better workers will socially pressure less efficient workers to work better. The group will decide their own standard of work and makesure everyone gets their stuff done.

# Conclusions
1. Social and psychological factors are important + good working conditions for productivity and satisfaction
2. Informal relations influence work more than formal titles
3. Employees do better if they can be involved in decision making and will be happier if they know management cares about them
4. Respect and dignity makes one do better work
5. Money is not the only incentive for productivity
6. Freedom to express their views makes better work
