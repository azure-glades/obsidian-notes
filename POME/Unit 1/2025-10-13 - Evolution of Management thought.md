# Max Webber - Bureaucratic Management
Max webber - sociologist
1. Management by standard rules - every org must have standard rules/manifesto that is followed
2. Division of labour - diff work for diff employees
3. Select people with technical skills - test and select people based on skills
4. Hierarchy - organize the company on hierarchy. Low level, mid level, top level employees and managers
5. Recording - all acts, decisions, activities, policies are recorded for future reference

# F.W. Taylor - Scientific management
Father of scientific management - Developed ideas on management when working at midwale steels.
Techniques
1. **Time & motion study** : Standard times for performing tasks. Timed the job of employees and measured time to understand how long it takes to do a task and how much time to allocate to each task.
2. **Differential wage payment** : Payment (incentive) linked to amount of work you do. More work implies more payment. Beyond standard work -> Bonus
3. **Functional Foremanship (Separation of "planning" & "doing")** : Separate people who will only PLAN. Employees only DO WORK
4. **Scientific recruitment & training of employees** : Employees should be recruited based on knowledge and skills that need to be tested. 
5. Friendly relations between management and workers
6. Supervision

# Henry Fayol - Administrative Management
Cooked up 14 principles of management
1. **Division of work** : All activities should be divided into groups based on similarity. People should be assigned these groups based on their skill & knowledge
2. **Unity of Command** : every employee has only 1 boss. Gets instruction from only 1 boss. Ideally a manager can only have atmost 6 people under him (span of a manager)
3. **Unity of direction** : there should be a single overall vision of the company towards which all dept work towards
4. **Centralization** : Degree of centralization should be based on employee skills and type of work
5. **Scalar chain** : hirearchy of organization. High manager -> manager -> supervisor -> worker etc. flow of information
6. **Authority & Responsibility** : Authority - Right to give orders/control. Responsibility - Being accountable for your task. Managers are responsible for their team and have authority over it
7. **Subordination of individual interest to general interest** : Organization is before individual
8. **Discipline** : Rules,  governing policies, procedures, timings etc. should be disciplined. Employees should obey policies and follow procedure
9. **Order** : Everything should be in place and structured properly. Needed for coordination, less time spent trying to find stuff.
10. **Renumeration** : Wages should be fair and consider the env, work, timings, etc
11. **Stability of tenure** : job should be secure, workers should want to stay for a long time.
12. **Equity** : fair treatment for all employees
13. **Initiative** : Employee should have freedom to carry out orders effectively
14. **Esprit de corps** : Team spirit. Employees should want to work, managers should ensure they want to work with each other as a team.
Drawbacks:
- Small groups - objectives can conflict between different groups
- Dissatisfaction of workers - some productive workers may feel bored with easy work
- Overhead cost - too many management personel means more overhead cost, more inefficiency
- Specialization - if a worker is specialized in different stuff, they may end up with many different bosses from different departments
- A limit of 6 can be limiting. Some managers can handle more than 6 people. Depends on skill of manager
# George Mayo - Human Relation Approach
Conducted [[Hawthorne Studies]] and drew conclusions on behaviour of humans in workspace.
- Workers in a group develop a relationship/bond that makes them more willing to work.
- Workers are motivated by non-financial factors (human relations and workplace) along with money and financial benefits
- Emotional factors play a big role in worker productivity
- Worker output is determined by group behaviours and interactions, not only  time and motion studies.
- Democratic style of supervision leads to better management
- Good leaders have good communication and relations with workers, and doesnt depend only on how efficient they are, or how good of a manager they are.
- Group interactions, rewards, dynamics etc is also important to study along with individual worker behaviour
