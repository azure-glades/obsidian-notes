## Chain of Command
A line of authority from higher to lower level through which orders and messages are passed. "Who reports to whom"
Importance:
- Employees know who to report to
- Boss only needs to manage a set of employees
- Clarity in reporting and decision making
- Responsibilities are more clear
Chain of command has 3 important concepts; authority, responsibility, unity of command

**Authority**
The right of managers to give order to employees to direct tasks. Employees have to obey the manager. Authority is used for coordination
Types of authority:
1. Line authority - In-line, direct control. employees must answer directly
2. Staff authority - Out-of-sight, indirect control
Managers are respected and have authority when
- Make rules clear
- Employee goals align with company goals
- No conflict with personal belief
- Person can complete tasks

**Responsibility**
Obligation to complete and report assigned tasks. Employees are held accountable for their tasks

**Unity of Command**
Employee should report to only 1 manager
## Span of Control
Max no. of employees a manager can successfully manage
Span depends on manager
- skill of manager
- nature of tasks
- employee skill and training
- proximity to workplace
- technology

# Acceptance theory of authority
Authority is not absolute and is dependent on the willingness of subordinates to accept it. Employees accept order only if:
1. they understand the order
2. order aligns with orgs goals
3. order does not conflict with personal beliefs
4. capable of completing the task

Responsibility - employees have responsibility to complete tasks and need authority to do it
Unity of command - Employee should report to only 1 manager to avoid confusion
