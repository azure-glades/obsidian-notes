The **BCG Matrix** (Boston Consulting Group Matrix) -> Corporate portfolio analysis tool. Basically to analyse which product is doing good, which product should be invested in, which can be shelved.
1. **Stars**
    - High market growth, high market share
    - Require heavy investment to maintain position
    - Potential to become Cash Cows
2. **Cash Cows**
    - Low market growth, very high market share -> Well-set product
    - Generate more cash than needed
    - Used to fund Stars or Question Marks
3. **Question Marks**
    - High market growth, low market share
    - Require investment to increase share
    - Can become Stars or Dogs depending on strategy
4. **Dogs**
    - Low market growth, low market share
    - Low profit or may operate at a loss
    - Often candidates for divestment or repositioning
The goal is to balance investments between these categories to ensure sustainable profitability and growth.

Goal: Innovation and expansion -> Invest in stars and question-marks since they have high growth potential
For cashcows -> if investment is less, retain it in same quadrant and leave them alone
For dogs -> divest (divert) the invested money to other products
