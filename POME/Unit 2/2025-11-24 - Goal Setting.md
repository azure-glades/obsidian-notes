Goal setting is the first part of any plan

# Types of goal setting

- purpose - direction for success over a long period of time

Learning goal setting
- focus : developing new skills, knowledge or competency
- purpose : track progress or growth

Performance goal setting
- focus : measuring specific outcome or result
- purpose : track performance and progress quantifyably

Process goal setting
- focus : steps to take to achieve a larger goal
- purpose : defining clear targets that represent success

Outcome goal setting
- focus: specific end-result or achievement
- purpose : breakdown big goals into manageable, actionable tasks

Social/Impact goal setting

# Things to consider when goal setting
## Long-term vs Short-term goals
Long-term goal : motivation and direction
Short-term goal : breakdown large objectives into small actionable steps

## Outcome vs Process goal
Outcome goal : measure the success of meeting objective
Process goal : steps to take to achieve desirable outcome

## Quantitative vs Qualitative goal
Quantitative : goal that can be measured - SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound)
Qualitative - Non-measurable goals that enhance personal and professional growth
