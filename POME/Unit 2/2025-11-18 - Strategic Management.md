# Organizational strategy
Broad approaches to achieve org goals and guide decision making at different levels of an org
1. **Corporate level** - direction of company is determined here. Ex: acquisitions, mergers
2. **Business level** - Analyze competition, focus on research etc.
3. **Functional level** - Day-to-day operational level. Ex: ad campagins etc.

## Corporate Level
Corporate strategy is the overall, *high-level* plan that guides an entire organization, defining its *long-term direction* across all its business units and markets to achieve its vision and mission.
Key aspects:
- **Scope:** Defining the industries, markets, and geographical areas the company will operate in.
- **Resource Allocation:** Determining how financial, human, and technological resources will be distributed among different business units.
### Growth Strategies
- **Focus:** Increasing the company's size, scope, or market share.
- **Methods:** Many methods
	- Concentration -> Improve primary business
	- Vertical Integration -> Take up retailing or supplying
	- Horizontal Integration -> Buy smaller companies or merge with other companies
	- Related/Unrelated diversification -> Enter new industries, explore other products
- **Example:** A retailer decides to open 100 new stores over the next three years (internal growth) or buys out a smaller competitor (external growth).
### Stability Strategies
- Focus: Maintain current size, scope and operations with continued profitability
- Methods: Improve efficiency, consolidate gains and invest into star products
- Example: A company decides to focus on maximizing profits from its established product line without expanding to new countries, ensuring consistency and strong performance.
### Retrenchment Strategies
- Focus: Reduce the scope of ops in certain products and refocus resources to cut losses
- Methods: *Liquidate assets* (sell assets and shut-down business), *Turnaround* (cut-cost and make more efficient), *Divestiture* (sell a unit and invest that into another unit)
- Example: Meta laying off employees
### Portfolio Strategies
- Focus: Managing a collection of business units to optimize total performance of the group
- Methods: [[2025-11-20 - BCG Matrix]]
- Example: Hindustan Unilever, Adani Group etc manage many different businesses
### Global Strategies
- Focus: Entering into new markets and expanding operations
- Methods:
	- **Global:** High standardization, low local responsiveness (treating the world as one market).
	- **Multi-domestic:** Low standardization, high local responsiveness (adapting products and advertising to local tastes).
	- **Transnational:** Seeking a balance between global efficiency and local responsiveness.
- Example: Nestle bringing local flavor variants to products

## Business Level/Competitive Strategy
Competitive strategy is a company's long-term plan for **how** it will achieve a *competitive advantage* over its rivals in a specific product market or industry segment.
Key approaches
- **Cost Leadership:** Achieve lower costs to offer products at lower prices
- **Differentiation:** Offer unique high quality products at premium prices
- **Focus:** Grow into a niche market and capture it
