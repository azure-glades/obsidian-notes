Forces that can affect competition
1. **Threat of new entrants:**  Ease/difficulty in which new competitors can enter a market and challenge business.
2. **Threat of Substitutes:** How much substitute or different products can cause customers to adopt that substitute over the product (phones substituted landlines)
	- Availability of substitutes, and cost of switching control widespread adoption of substitutes
	- Brand loyalty makes it harder for substitutes
	- Differentiation/Unique products are hard to replace.
	- Cost leadership can make it harder for substitutes
3. **Bargaining power of suppliers: Suppliers can influence price of product.**
	- No. of suppliers, availability of substitute, uniqueness of supplies
	- High demand, low supply -> High dependence on supplier -> Supplier can charge more rate for supplies
	- Backward integration & differentiation can prevent this
4. **Bargaining power of buyers: Buyers can influence price of product:**
	- No. of buyers, availability of substitute, lower price or high quality products
	- Cost leadership -> Competitive prices keep buyers happy
	- Differentiation -> Unique value means buyers are willing to pay more
5. **Industry Rivalry:** Intensity of competition between rival companies
	- Rival products, rival marketing, innovation, no. of competitors etc.
	- Cost leadership -> Harder to be outcompeted
	- Differentiation -> Unique product is harder to dethrone
	- Focus -> Niche market has less competition
