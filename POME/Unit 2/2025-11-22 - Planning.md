# Nature of planning
1. Intellectual - it involves thinking of the future, of actions, when to take them and who should take them
2. Goal-oriented - you must define a proper specific goal before planning. All planning is done to reach this goal
3. Forward looking - planning is done looking ahead into the future, to predict what can happen with current facts
4. Managerial - planning is done by managers to reach a goal. Basic task of all managers at all levels
5. Primary task - its the first task that a manager has to do before they go to organizing
6. Factual - based on ground reality and facts. If plan is made on false information it will always fail. Important task is to collect info and then plan
7. Flexible - it is a dynamic process, plan should be adjusted as we learn new facts and as work gets done slowly
8. Decision making - it is essentially deciding what decisions to take in the future
# Steps in planning
1. List out objectives - these are the goals to reach
2. Identify and define problems - these are the problems that lie between reaching you goals, plan should overcome these
3. Facts - collect facts and analyze it. To understand what factors will affect your goals and collect information on this
4. Forecasting - understand what hurdles u might get in the future that will cause issues
5. Alternatives - look into various different course of actions you could take to reach your goals. Look into all possible actions and see what could happen in each of them
6. Evaluate alternatives - evaluate all these possible courses of actions, based on whether they reach objectives, are they feasible, economical etc
7. Best course of action - pick the best course of action and refine that plan clearly
8. Follow up - Put the plan into action

# Essentials of a sound plan
1. Clear objectives - goals to reach cannot be vague. Else you dont know what u are trying to achieve
2. Well understood - everyone involved in executing it should know what they are trying to do.
3. Flexible - you cannot get fucked over if unexpected shit happens. You should be able to modify a plan to deal with unexpected stuff in the future
4. Stable - a plan must not fail at any step of the process. It should be clear enough to allow modification but not such that the whole thing fails
5. All encompassing - it should cover all aspects of business in detail
6. Economical - it should be cheap or executable within the current resources of the company. It should be doable, not unrealistic
Most important step of a plan is to actually do it.

2. Objectives/goals - various real objectives that must be reached to further a mission
3. Strategies - Quick plans drafted up as reactions to market changes, competitors etc that aim to achieve different goals or missions.
Major types of planning
## Operational Planning
Planning for jobs and activities. Sets specific tasks, procedures and steps. Helps in assigning responsibility.

Key feature:
- Fairness and consistency in tasks
- Who,what,where,how and how-much


## 🗺️ Strategic Planning
- **Focus:** Sets the **long-term direction** and overall major goals for the entire organization (e.g., 3-5 years or more). It defines _what_ the organization wants to achieve and _why_.
	- Strategies are based on vision, mission, value
- **Scope:** Broadest. 
	- Organization's mission, vision, values
	- Strategies are made based on market trends and competitors
- **Level:** Typically done by **top management** (CEO, Board of Directors).
- **Example:** A technology company's strategic plan is to **"Become the market leader in sustainable consumer electronics within five years."**
## 🎯 Tactical Planning
- **Focus:** Translates the strategic goals into **specific, shorter-term actions** and resource allocations for functional areas or departments (e.g., 1-3 years). It addresses _how_ the organization will implement the strategy.
- **Scope:** Mid-level; focused on departmental goals and the deployment of resources.
- **Level:** Typically done by **middle management** (Department Heads, Division Managers).
- **Example:** To support the strategic goal, the Marketing department's tactical plan is to **"Launch three major eco-friendly product campaigns within the next 18 months"** and the R&D department's is to **"Develop a new biodegradable casing material by year two."**
## 🛠️ Operational Planning
- **Focus:** Deals with the **day-to-day execution** of tasks and procedures necessary to achieve tactical goals (e.g., under 1 year, often weekly or daily). It details the _who_, _when_, and _where_ of activities.
	- Single-use plan : for one time activity
	- Ongoing plan : For long-term or repeated activities.
		- Rules - guidelines for behaviour
		- Procedures - to define a set of actions to deal with a circumstance
		- Policies - guidelines to help make decisions
- **Scope:** Narrowest
	- Efficiency and standardization of routine activities
- **Level:** Typically done by **lower-level management/supervisors** (Team Leads, Shift Managers).
- **Example:** To support the tactical plan, a manufacturing supervisor creates an operational plan that details **"The daily production schedule, quality control checklists, and shift assignments for assembling the new product line."**
## 🚨 Contingency Planning
- **Focus:** Develops **alternative courses of action** to be used if the primary plan (strategic, tactical, or operational) is disrupted by unforeseen events or emergencies. It is a "Plan B."
- **Scope:** Variable; focused on risk management and business continuity. It is proactively developed for a range of possible scenarios.
- **Level:** Often involves multiple levels of management, depending on the severity of the potential crisis.
- **Example:** A contingency plan outlines **"The steps to reroute production to an alternate facility and communicate with key suppliers and customers in the event of a natural disaster disrupting the main factory operations."**
